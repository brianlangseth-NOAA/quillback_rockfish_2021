This assessment reports the status of quillback rockfish (\emph{Sebastes maliger}) off the California coast using data through 2020.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The stock off the California coast was assessed as a separate stock from other populations off the U.S. West Coast based on the fairly sedentary nature of quillback rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hannah and Rankin 2011; Tolimieri et al. 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, which likely limits movement of fish between California and Oregon. Additionally, the exploitation history and magnitude of removals off the California coast differ from those in Oregon. Although the population of quillback rockfish in California is assessed statewide, given the range of quillback rockfish, this assessment is primarily of quillback rockfish north of Point Conception. Catches of quillback rockfish south of Point Conception were rare, however, where available, these data were used within this assessment.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish are a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Off the U.S. West Coast quillback rockfish are primarily located north of central California, with few observations south of Point Conception. Quillback rockfish have historically been part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout their range.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish are found in waters less than 274 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The diets of quillback rockfish consist primarily of benthic and pelagic crustaceans and fish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Murie 1995)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The body coloring of adult quillback rockfish is brown with yellow to orange blotching and light-colored dorsal saddle patches {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. As their name suggests, quillback rockfish have long dorsal fin spines.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Limited studies have evaluated genetic variation in quillback rockfish across the U.S. West Coast. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of quillback rockfish {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Seeb 1998; Stout et al. 2001)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, however Seeb {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(1998)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} did not find significant differentiation in populations of quillback rockfish between coastal Washington and Alaska. Significant population sub-division along the U.S. West Coast has been detected for the closely related, and more well-studied copper rockfish (\emph{Sebastes caurinus}), indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Seeb 1998; Buonaccorsi et al. 2002; Johansson et al. 2008)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. High site-fidelity {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Hannah and Rankin 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and relatively small home ranges {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Tolimieri et al. 2009)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for quillback rockfish suggests patterns of isolation-by-distance as found for other rockfish.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish are a long-lived rockfish estimated to live up to 95 years {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Love, Yoklavich, and Thorsteinson 2002; Yamanako and Lacko 2001)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Quillback rockfish was determined to have a vulnerability (V = 2.22) of major concern in a productivity susceptibility analysis {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Cope et al. 2011)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. This analysis calculated species specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history, and susceptibility characterized by how the stock is likely affected by the fishery in question.

\emph{Commercial}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish off the coast of California is caught in both the recreational and commercial fisheries. Recreational removals are the largest source of fishing mortality and represent approximately 70 percent of the total removals of quillback rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The majority of the commercial landings for quillback rockfish occurred between 1990 and 2008, and apart from 1945-1946, in 1984, and in the last four years, commercial landings for quillback rockfish have been less than 2 mt per year.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Prior to the development of the live-fish market in the 1980s, commercial catches of quillback rockfish were relatively low, and quillback rockfish were often landed dead for a relatively low ex-vessel price per pound. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets, and in some instances, trawl gear. Trawling within three miles of shore, where most of their habitat is found, has been prohibited since 1953, and gill nets were banned within three miles of shore in 1994. Whether from directed effort in the nearshore or as incidental catch while targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod, catches were below 0.5 mt from 1916 to 1980, with the exception of four of five years from 1944-1948.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live-fish fishery during the late 1980s and early 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel prices for live fish, resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Wilson-Vandenberg, Larinto, and Key 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including a requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain quillback rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, and with permit issuance based on historical landings history by a retrospective qualifying date. The result was a reduction in permits issued, from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, seasonal closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from these species low ACLs.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

As overfished shelf rockfish have rebuilt, resumed access to deeper depths has been allowed for Nearshore Permit holders as well as open access fisheries. While depth restrictions for waters deeper than 75 fm were implemented in 2019 south of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are uncommon, access in constrained north of Point Conception where, since 2003, depth restrictions at a range of depths starting between 20 and 40 fm, depending on the management area, have prohibited fishing in deeper waters (see separately provided Regulation History addendum).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

As open access fisheries are allowed to retain shelf rockfish species co-occurring with nearshore rockfish species within the open depths, there is growing concern regarding increased encounters by non-permit holders and greater discard mortality from bycatch in deeper depths given that discard mortality is 100\% in depths greater than 30 fm. This is of particular concern given both increased trip limits for shelf rockfish species and less constraining depth restrictions allow increased access to these species, as well as drive increased participation in the open access fishery, and therefore increased total mortality. In addition, coverage rates for observers from the WCGOP on small vessels participating in these fisheries provide limited data to inform bycatch rates. Under National Standard 8, reduction of bycatch is a priority and increased observer coverage rates would improve data on discards as the open access fishery for shelf rockfish expands.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

\emph{Recreational}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The California recreational fishery in the early part of the 1900s was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Miller et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Prior to the groundfish fishery disaster being declared in 2000, there was no time or areas closures for fishing groundfish. During this period, access to deeper depths led to effort being spread over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species from the shelf as well as the nearshore. This resulted in lower catch rates for nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when depth restrictions at a range of depths starting between 20 to 50 fm were put in place in various management areas north of Point Conception where quillback rockfish are commonly found. This shift of effort into the nearshore kept catch levels high for nearshore rockfish, including quillback rockfish (Figure \ref{fig:catch}), despite greatly reduced seasons. While the part of the stock that was available to the fishery in shallower depths was subject to higher fishing effort, the remainder of the stock (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for estimates of density at depth based on remotely operated vehicle observations) was subject to reduced fishing effort during more than a decade of depth restrictions in waters deeper than 20 to 30 fm that were put in place to facilitate rebuilding of yelloweye rockfish.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

As the yelloweye rockfish stock continues to rebuild, depth restrictions are expected to lessen, increasing access to more of the habitat for quillback rockfish. Once fishing is allowed in waters up to 60 fm, effort for quillback rockfish may decrease as overall effort shifts to the shelf and away from waters where quillback rockfish are most prevalent. Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) instituted between 2003 and 2012 now encompass 20-30\% of the rocky reef habitat within 3 miles of shore in state waters (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_b}{Appendix B}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details), and provide refugia to spawning stock in a network designed to seed areas outside the MPAs.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Minor Nearshore Rockfish North and Minor Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South complexes are split at N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. off the U.S. West Coast. Each complex is managed based on a complex-level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFL and ACL (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catch) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex. Removals for species within each complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Quillback rockfish was most recently assessed in 2010 using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) to provide estimates of coastwide OFLs {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Dick and MacCall 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The coastwide OFL was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of N. 40{\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(^\circ\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} 10' Lat. DB-SRA does not assess overfished status, but rather assumes that current depletion is distributed around the management target (e.g.~40\%). The 2010 assessment found there was a 52\% chance that quillback rockfish was experiencing overfishing, as recent coastwide catch of quillback rockfish slightly exceeded the median coastwide OFL estimate at the time.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial landings for quillback rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live vs.~dead. This choice was driven by the limited length composition data for each gear type, and the fact that length distributions were similar by gear type. Additionally, commercial length data available in the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for California did not have the needed information to identify samples from live vs.~dead fish (e.g., condition code), preventing the ability to evaluate the data based on live vs.~dead landings.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial landings estimates for 1916 - 1969 from the California Catch Reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} were queried from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) catch reconstruction database. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, `non-trawl', and `unknown' gear categories, for various regions within California. Additional catches between 1948-1968 landed at California ports but caught off Oregon and Washington were added to the landings from the catch reconstruction to represent total catches landed at California ports. Estimated catches of quillback rockfish from this additional analysis were very small and totaled approximately 0.30 mt over all years, with no more than 0.08 mt in any one year.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969 - 1979 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts (``fish tickets''), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These `ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969 - 1979 for all port complexes. Catches during this time for quillback rockfish are negligible. See Appendix A of Dick et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2007)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for further details.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Commercial fishery landings from 1984-2020 were obtained from PacFIN (extracted 2/21/2021). There were no quillback rockfish catches in PacFIN from 1981-1983 so landings of quillback rockfish from 1981-1983 were set equal to the average landings from the three years before (1978 - 1980) and after (1984 - 1986) this time period.

The input catches in the model represent total removals, which equal landings plus discards (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002 - 2019 were determined based on WCGOP data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. Discards were added to landings to obtain total removals for 2002-2019. Total removals prior to 2002, and for 2020 where no WCGOP data were yet available, were calculated using the average discard rates from WCGOP in 2002-2018 for California (3.6 percent).

Length data of quillback rockfish collected from commercial fisheries from 1978-2020 was extracted from PacFIN (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}, extracted 2/23/2021). Samples were very sparse prior to 1991 and consisted of only three samples, one each in 1978, 1984, and 1987, which were not used in model fitting (i.e.~used as a `ghost' fleet, not fit by the model but implied fits reflected in diagnostic output). Length samples were most numerous during the 1990s, while since 2002 the number of length samples has been relatively low. The sizes observed from 1991 - 2002 were relatively broad, ranging from approximately 20 - 50 cm (the largest data bin; Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Since approximately 2003, the range of sizes observed have shrunk to around 30 - 45 cm, while tending toward larger sizes over time. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year, which have increased from around 35 cm to above 40 cm since 2003 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The shift in mean size could be due to shifts in fishery behavior, sampling, changes in the population demographics (e.g., lack of strong recruitment), or a combination of multiple factors.

Recreational landings from 1928 - 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Ralston et al. 2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS. The MRFSS dataset also includes removals in 1980, however Ralston et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2010)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} considered their 1980 estimate to be more reliable than that of MRFSS, so landings from the historical reconstructions were preferred for 1980. The total removals for the missing years between the MRFSS and CRFS datasets, 1990 - 1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals between the 1989 and 1993 values. Removals in 1993 were some of the largest for the recreational fleet across all years, so the effects of assuming an average catch from 1989 and 1994 for 1993, and altering the ramp was explored as a Sensitivity (see Section \ref{sensitivity-analyses} for details). Both data sources, MRFSS and CRFS, provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish. Discard estimates for the recreational fleet for years between 1928 - 1980 were calculated based on the discard rate (1.7 percent) from the MRFSS and CRFS data in years 1980-2004. A direct breakdown of the landed and discarded fish by weight was not available for these years, so the proportion by number of total dead catch that was unavailable to the sampler, which included dead discarded fish, was calculated and averaged across years.

The recreational fishery is the main source of mortality for quillback rockfish in California (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}).

Recreational length samples from MRFSS for years 1980 - 2003 and from CRFS for years 2004 - 2020 were obtained from the RecFIN website. Lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) prior to being released (Type 3d data) were also obtained from 2003 to 2020, however released samples (n = 23) were not used in length compositions for the base model. The number of length observations by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}, with the highest number of samples occurring in years since 2004. The distribution of lengths of quillback rockfish observed by the recreational fleet have generally ranged between 20 and 50 cm (the maximum length data bin size) across all available years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). Samples in years prior to 1989 generally were more uniformly distributed and had smaller samples sizes than in more recent years. The mean length observed each year was more variable within and among years prior to the mid 1990s, ranging from slightly above 40 cm to slightly below 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}).

No fishery-independent data sources that are commonly incorporated in West Coast groundfish assessments (as required by the data moderate Terms of Reference) had adequate sample size of quillback rockfish off the California coast to include abundance indices for this assessment. The WCGBTS, the Hook and Line survey, and the Triennial survey collect data off the California coast on rockfish biology and abundance. There were no more than ten positive tows of quillback rockfish in any one year coastwide in the WCGBTS, and typically fewer than five. Similarly there were no more than five positive tows of quillback rockfish in any one year coastwide for the Triennial survey. No quillback rockfish were captured in the Hook and Line survey. Given that indices of abundance were not calculated due to small sample sizes, length composition data from the WCGBTS (n = 91) and Triennial Survey (n = 42) off California were not included in the model. Biological data from the WCGBTS survey was used in external calculations of biological parameters, including growth and weight-at-length relationships.

Then et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2015)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} provided an updated data set of estimates of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least-squares estimator {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. The approach of basing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments.

Ages from Oregon special projects samples taken from the Oregon commercial fleet (n = 30) were not included. Age data were generally sparse for quillback rockfish from any one source (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). The fishery-dependent data had limited observations of young fish less than 5 years of age, but had observations of fish up to 73 years of age.

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, and natural mortality was fixed at 0.057, as described above in Section \ref{priors}.

Selectivity in the recreational and commercial fleets was fixed to be asymptotic with only ascending width and beginning size of maximum selectivity being estimated. During initial model development, the descending width and width of maximum selectivity parameters for the recreational and commercial fleets were estimated to identify appropriate fixed values consistent with the data, and then fixed at those estimates. Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model as sensitivities (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{sensitivity-analyses}{Sensitivity Analyses}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} section). Older quillback rockfish are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. Dome shaped selectivity can also occur under heterogeneous fishing pressure across space by fleets {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(Waterhouse et al. 2014)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Given the depth closures in the recreational fishery off California it was initially assumed that large quillback rockfish would not be caught in the fishery indicating dome-shaped selectivity. However, lengths at depth of quillback rockfish from Remote Operated Vehicle data suggested larger quillback rockfish occur across depths and are not limited to depths closed to fishing (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_a}{Appendix A}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details). This information lead to the assumption of asymptotic selectivity for the recreational fleet for the base model.

The base assessment model for quillback rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, with the goal of estimating a spawning output trajectory for the population of quillback rockfish off California.

The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}.

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Strong recruitment events were estimated prior to 2000 and in 2011. Recruitment deviations in 1987, 1996, and 1999 were particularly strong and resulted in an increase in biomass during the early 2000s. While the largest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in these three specific years, the surrounding years in the 1980s and 1990s also have above average recruitment estimated. Recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s however were highly uncertain, with standard errors extending above the value of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(\sigma_R\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (0.6), suggesting recruitment during these years is not strongly informed by the data. Recruitment deviations for 1996 and 1999 were less uncertain, with standard errors below that of \$\sigma\_R, suggesting these two recruitments were more informed by the data. Below average recruitment was estimated in all years since 2000, with the exception of 2011. Bias adjustment was applied to the annual estimates of recruitment deviations following the pattern of transformed variances in recent years as shown in Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The general pattern in recruitment deviations showed fairly close coherence with the recruitment deviations estimated in the separate Oregon model. The Oregon base model estimated above average recruitment in the late 1990s, though for fewer years, and a strong recruitment pulse in 2012. This may potentially suggest that quillback rockfish off the coast of California and Oregon experience similar drivers in recruitment.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The large recruitment pulses in the 1980s and 1990s primarily show up in the composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets as a steady range of sizes across years, but also as a pulse of young fish around 2000 and 2001 for the commercial and recreational fleets. The recruitment pulse in 1999 does not clearly show up as a single pulse of young fish in later years but is probably aggregated with the 1996 recruitment pulse to support the trend of increasing mean size for both the commercial and recreational fleets. The increasing mean size in the recreational and commercial fleet after 2005 along with minimal catches of smaller fish in the composition data supports the below average recruitment in the 2000s. The 2011 recruitment pulse shows up primarily in the composition data for the recreational fleet as pulses of smaller fish in 2015-2017 that are also reflected by declines in mean size. The commercial fleet also shows some pulses of smaller fish in 2017-2018 along with declines in mean size, with the later time frame likely being due to a right shifted selectivity curve compared to the recreational fleet.

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for each of the commercial and recreational fleets.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery have no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data across cohorts but show areas of misfit over time (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The residuals show that the peak of the composition is being underfit in many years since 2001, where sample sizes are lower and the distributions have a prominent peak (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_c}{Appendix C}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details). The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery were variable by year, with higher variation since 2004 given smaller sample size, and showed an increase in mean length starting in 2007 and a decline after 2014 (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). The increase in mean size estimated by the model was substantially less than the increase in mean size observed in the data, and likely a consequence of smaller sample size for commercial lengths compared to recreational lengths during this time.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data were variable by year and indicate no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Positive residuals at the edges of the distribution in years before 2004 , which are the largest residuals, are indicative of widely spread distributions with lower sample size. In years since 2004, there are periods of positive and negative residuals in clusters over two to five years. The positive residuals indicate underfitting of peaked distributions (e.g.~in 2006-2010, or in 2012-2014), whereas negative residuals indicate overfitting of the distribution as it skews to the left or right (e.g.~2005-2007 or 2015-2019; see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_c}{Appendix C}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details). The mean length decreased from a high around 40cm in the early 1980s through the 1990s to under 30cm, and then increased slightly through 2004. After 2004, the variation in mean length was reduced, and mean length varied around 35 cm, with increases through 2013 and decline in 2015 and 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The mean length was highly variable in 2002 due to low sample size (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}) and a flat length distribution.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet well. Both fleets show similar ranges of sizes caught and a central tendency of 36 cm. The commercial fleet is more peaked compared to the recreational fleet, which has a more rounded peak around its central tendency and slight shift toward smaller sizes. The model expects a slightly higher proportion of the largest fish for both fleets relative to the data. This may indicate that the true selectivity of the recreational and commercial fleets may have some level of reduced selectivity for the largest fish (i.e.~dome-shape). Sensitivities examining dome-shaped selectivity form were performed and presented in the {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{sensitivity-analyses}{Sensitivity Analyses}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} section below.

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates and adjusting phases of the estimated parameters to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were first jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 64 out of 100 runs returning to the base model likelihood. A lower negative log-likelihood model fit was not found and all runs converged. When parameters were jittered by 25 percent, 57 of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A lower negative log-likelihood model fit was again not found. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles (described below), we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability throughout initial model attempts and all explorations resulted in a positive-definite Hessian.

In regards to values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at a ln({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) of 3.17 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The commercial data supported lower ln({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) values around 2.75 whereas the recreational data supported ln({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) near the base model value. Increasing {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(R_0\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} relative to the base model value resulted in an increase in stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-depl}).

Higher values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reduced unfished spawning output but increased recent spawning output so the range of stock status varied from below the management precautionary zone (between 0.25 - 0.40) for lower values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} to within and above the management precautionary zone for higher values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(M\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} (Figure \ref{fig:m-depl}).

The stock scale varied across alternative {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values where assuming lower values resulted in increased recent spawning output and assuming higher values resulted in increased unfished spawning output but decreased recent spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb}). Lower values of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} compared to the base resulted in a range of stock status from within, and above the management precautionary zone whereas higher {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} resulted in greater levels of depletion (Figure \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

The choice also matters in the sense that estimating growth parameters results in a different stock status compared to the base model. Despite well defined profiles for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, we decided to keep the fixed values in the base model given the relatively limited length composition data, concerns over whether length data on its own without age data can inform {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, that the curve of estimated {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(L_{\infty}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} values poorly fit the age and length data, and that growth estimates used in the model were based on data with young fish from the surveys to inform the estimate of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(k\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}.

Variation in recruitment deviations remains an unresolved problem. Recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s were highly variable, and variance was higher than the assumed value for {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(sigmaR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}. We explored numerous ways to account for this, with the only solution reducing recruitment deviations to below the value of {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(sigmaR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} was by reducing the variability in size at older ages to very small values (\textasciitilde0.01). Under such a scenario, the trajectory of the population was very similar to the base model as was the pattern of stronger than average recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s followed by weaker than average recruitment deviations in the 2000s. Consequently, this remains an unresolved problem that does not appear to greatly affect model results.

Lastly, catches of quillback rockfish were particularly high in a few years for both the recreational and commercial fleets. Although not affecting estimates of depletion, averaging out these high years of catches affected model scale and therefore estimates of sustainable yield. Changes to catches affecting model scale is true of all models that assume catch is well known, however for quillback rockfish in California the magnitude of the reduction in catch for these years was approximately 20 percent of the total removals. Better understanding the factors contributing to these high catches as well as potential resolutions, should they be needed, would aid in ensuring catch time series and resulting estimates of sustainable yield are accurate.

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields were 8.41 mt when using an {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SB_{40\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) was 24.58 millions of eggs.

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the threshold of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(1-SPR\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}, has been above the harvest rate limit ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(SPR_{50\%}\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}) in all years but four years from 1975-2009, and in all but three years since (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Figure \ref{fig:phase-plot} shows the phase plot of relative spawning output and fishing intensity. Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

A ten year projection of the base model was estimated for years 2023-2032, with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying sigma and {\tagstructbegin{tag=Formula}\tagmcbegin{tag=Formula}\(P^*\)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} = 0.45 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted ACLs for the southern management area and the percent allocation (28.7 percent) for California in the northern management area provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT, personal communication). ACLs were apportioned to recreational and commercial catches based on the average proportion from 2018-2020 each fleet contributes to the total catch.

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for quillback rockfish was limited by data. Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\begin{itemize}

  \item At the time of the assessment due to issues in California data in PacFIN (i.e., condition code) length samples landed live vs. dead from the commercial were unable to be identified. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landings would allow for future assessments to account for a greater range of commercial fishing behavior.
  
  \item Improved understanding of where recreational fishing is commonly occurring (areas and depths) and the range of sizes available by depth would better inform the selectivity form, which currently is the near the shape for maturity.  

    \item Age data were predominantly from Oregon and Washington waters. Collecting length and otolith samples from recreational and commercial catches in California would result in samples from the entire U.S. West Coast informing growth.
    
    \item Recruitment patterns showed lower than average recruitment in the 2000s. Additional data to support such patterns in recruitment would provide additional support for model estimates. 
    
    \item Catches of quillback rockfish were particularly high in a few years for both the recreational and commercial fleet. Better understanding the factors contributing to these high catches as well as potential resolutions, should they be needed, would aid in ensuring catch time series are accurate.

Many people were instrumental in the successful completion of this assessment and their contribution is greatly appreciated. We are very grateful to all the agers at WDFW, ODFW, and the CAP lab for their hard work reading numerous otoliths and availability to answer questions when needed. Jason Jannot and Kayleigh Sommers assisted with data from the WCGOP and entertained our many questions. We would like to acknowledge the data team and their dedication to improving the assessments we do. John Harms, Brenda Erwin, and Jason Edwards were incredibly helpful in understanding the available data and resolving questions about its interpretation and use. All of the data moderate assessments this year were greatly benefited by the numerous individuals who took the time to participate in the pre-assessment data webinar. Gerry Richter, Merit McCrea, Louis Zimm, Bill James, and Daniel Platt provided insight to the data and the complexities of the commercial and recreational fisheries off the West Coast of the U.S. which were essential in the production of all of the quillback rockfish assessments conducted this year.

\subsection{Appendix A: California ROV Survey Data Informing Selectivity}\label{append_a}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

From 2013-2015, the CDFW in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE), conducted Remote Operated Vehicle (ROV) surveys along the full length of the California coastline inside MPAs and in reference sites outside for comparison. Density estimates were produced from the ratio of observed fish per unit area observed over the area of seafloor observed by the ROV in fish per meter squared. The percent relative density reflecting the proportion of the density observed in each depth bin was estimated relative to the sum of the density values in observed depths. A particular advantage of ROV data compared to other data sources is the accuracy of the depth of encounter of individual fish, providing useful information regarding selectivity of fishing gear relative to the depth distribution of fish observed by the ROV. Depth restrictions north of Point Conception varied from 20 to 40 fm for most of the last two decades. Densities were highest in the depths of 10 to 50 fm. Therefore, fish occur at depths greater than those that are open to fishing, indicating depth restrictions offer protection of quillback rockfish biomass (Table \ref{tab:ca-ROV}).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

In addition, length frequency distributions by depth were determined from fish observed by the ROV based on visual approximations using the distance between paired lasers. While future efforts to increase the precision of length estimates include using stereo-camera data and programs estimating length from trigonometric calculations, the trends in approximate length distribution with depth still provides useful information. The length frequency distribution by depth is provided in Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV}. In reviewing both the density by depth and length by depth relative to ontogenetic migration, the patterns may not reflect the smaller fish using shallow rocky reef as juveniles in less than 10 fm, and only reflect the density and composition in deeper depths where ontogenetic migration to deeper depths has already taken place for nearshore species and is not as apparent.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

When examining the length composition data by depth inside and outside of MPAs north of Point Conception (Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV}), no extreme differences in composition were observed, which is not surprising given the relatively recent implementation of MPAs north of Point Conception between 2007 and 2012. The MPAs make up 20-30\% of the rocky reef habitat in state waters within three miles of shore and are intended to preserve the larger individuals as biomass accumulates in MPAs over time. The combination of MPAs and RCAs restrict a larger portion of habitat to fishing (see {\tagstructbegin{tag=Link}\tagmcbegin{tag=Link}\protect\hyperlink{append_b}{Appendix B}\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} for details).

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The percentage of fish in 5 cm size categories among 10 fm depths bins north of Point Conception did not show clear signs of increasing size with depth in greater than 10 fm in either region or protected vs.~reference sites (Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV-percent}). This may be in part due to the fish having already moved from shallow kelp forest habitat where the ROV cannot operate to the adult depth distribution in greater than 10 fm by the time they are observed. Only in the shallower depth bins is there higher proportion of smaller individuals. This would indicate that selectivity may not be domed shaped as would be considered if the depth restrictions protected a larger proportion of adult biomass.

\subsection{Appendix B: Percent Area Closed to Fishing in the RCAs and MPAs over time}\label{append_b}}

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

MPAs were instituted at various times from 2003 to 2012 as the area selection process was undertaken on a regional process. The existence of no take MPAs in some of the areas selected prior to expansion of the MPAs to encompass approximately 20-30\% of rocky reef habitat in state waters, duration of existence of new areas, degree of effort prior to protection or criteria for selection including productivity of the reef may have contributed to the current patterns in composition and density inside vs.~outside MPAs. As biomass accrues inside MPAs, accounting for protections through area-based assessment methods or effects on selectivity should be considered as fishery dependent data will only reflect the length composition and density outside the MPAs.

\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend\par

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

The percentage area closed to fishing in MPAs and Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs) north of Point Conception from 2001 to 2021 are shown in Table \ref{tab:ca-mpa}. The percentage closed to fishing provides a buffer against uncertainty through protection of a portion of the population. The percent area in MPAs prohibiting take by the recreational and commercial fisheries were included in the estimates of area closed to fishing from the first year in which the MPA was in place for a full calendar year. Areas closed to fishing prior to the implementation of the present MPA network were also accounted for. The RCAs for commercial and recreational fisheries were based on the deeper of the depth restrictions for the sectors to reflect only areas where take was prohibited for both. Where the RCA lines for the stock in question were not available, depth contours were used to approximate the percent of area closed. The presence of each type of closure in each assessment region and year was converted to tables of Boolean fields allowing GIS algorithms estimating the area open and closed to fishing. The distribution and area of rocky reef habitat was determined using the GIS layers rendering the results of the side scanning sonar from the California Seafloor Mapping Project to identify hard bottom at varying levels of resolution from two square meters to ten meters based on the depth surveyed due to cone width of the sonar. The area of rocky reef habitat closed to fishing within the depth distribution of the focal species was converted to a percentage of the total habitat.
