## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

#### Landings

Commercial landings for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live vs. dead. This choice was driven by the limited length composition data for each gear type, and the fact that length distributions were similar by gear type. Additionally, commercial length data available in the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for California did not have the needed information to identify samples from live vs. dead fish (e.g., condition code), preventing the ability to evaluate the data based on live vs. dead landings. 

Commercial landings estimates for 1916 - 1969 from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010] were queried from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) catch reconstruction database. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories, for various regions within `r state`. Additional catches between 1948-1968 landed at California ports but caught off Oregon and Washington were added to the landings from the catch reconstruction to represent total catches landed at California ports. Estimated catches of `r spp` from this additional analysis were very small and totaled approximately 0.30 mt over all years, with no more than 0.08 mt in any one year.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969 - 1979 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969 - 1979 for all port complexes. Catches during this time for `r spp` are negligible. See Appendix A of Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for further details.

Commercial fishery landings from 1984-2020 were obtained from PacFIN (extracted 2/21/2021). There were no `r spp` catches in PacFIN from 1981-1983 so landings of `r spp` from 1981-1983 were set equal to the average landings from the three years before (1978 - 1980) and after (1984 - 1986) this time period. 

The input catches in the model represent total removals, which equal landings plus discards (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002 - 2019 were determined based on WCGOP data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. Discards were added to landings to obtain total removals for 2002-2019. Total removals prior to 2002, and for 2020 where no WCGOP data were yet available, were calculated using the average discard rates from WCGOP in 2002-2018 for `r state` (3.6 percent).


#### Length Compositions 

Length data of `r spp` collected from commercial fisheries from 1978-2020 was extracted from PacFIN (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}, extracted 2/23/2021). Samples were very sparse prior to 1991 and consisted of only three samples, one each in 1978, 1984, and 1987, which were not used in model fitting (i.e. used as a 'ghost' fleet, not fit by the model but implied fits reflected in diagnostic output). Length samples were most numerous during the 1990s, while since 2002 the number of length samples has been relatively low. The sizes observed from 1991 - 2002 were relatively broad, ranging from approximately 20 - 50 cm (the largest data bin; Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Since approximately 2003, the range of sizes observed have shrunk to around 30 - 45 cm, while tending toward larger sizes over time. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year, which have increased from around 35 cm to above 40 cm since 2003 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The shift in mean size could be due to shifts in fishery behavior, sampling, changes in the population demographics (e.g., lack of strong recruitment), or a combination of multiple factors. 

The input sample sizes for the commercial length data were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) which incorporate the number of trips and fish by year:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Recreational / Sport Fishery

#### Landings

Recreational landings from 1928 - 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS. The MRFSS dataset also includes removals in 1980, however Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] considered their 1980 estimate to be more reliable than that of MRFSS, so landings from the historical reconstructions were preferred for 1980. The total removals for the missing years between the MRFSS and CRFS datasets, 1990 - 1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals between the 1989 and 1993 values. Removals in 1993 were some of the largest for the recreational fleet across all years, so the effects of assuming an average catch from 1989 and 1994 for 1993, and altering the ramp was explored as a Sensitivity (see Section \ref{sensitivity-analyses} for details). Both data sources, MRFSS and CRFS, provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish. Discard estimates for the recreational fleet for years between 1928 - 1980 were calculated based on the discard rate (1.7 percent) from the MRFSS and CRFS data in years 1980-2004. A direct breakdown of the landed and discarded fish by weight was not available for these years, so the proportion by number of total dead catch that was unavailable to the sampler, which included dead discarded fish, was calculated and averaged across years.  

The recreational fishery is the main source of mortality for `r spp` in `r state` (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Recreational removals peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with two years of exceptionally large catches in 1984 and 1993. Removals declined sharply in 1994, but increased to levels similar to the late 1970s and early 1980s in the mid 2000s and again in recent years. 


#### Length Compositions 

Recreational length samples from MRFSS for years 1980 - 2003 and from CRFS for years 2004 - 2020 were obtained from the RecFIN website. Lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) prior to being released (Type 3d data) were also obtained from 2004 to 2020, however released samples (n = 22) were not used in length compositions for the base model. The number of length observations by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}, with the highest number of samples occurring in years since 2004. The distribution of lengths of `r spp` observed by the recreational fleet have generally ranged between 20 and 50 cm (the maximum length data bin size) across all available years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). Samples in years prior to 1989 generally were more uniformly distributed and had smaller samples sizes than in more recent years. The mean length observed each year was more variable within and among years prior to the mid 1990s, ranging from slightly above 40 cm to slightly below 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}). Since 2005, mean length has been less variable across years, between 35 and 40 cm, with less variation within each year as well.

The input sample sizes for the recreational length data were set equal to the number of length samples available by year.
