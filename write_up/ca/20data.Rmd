# Data
The following types and sources of data were used in this assessment. Fishery catch and composition data were specific to `r state`, however biological data were estimated coastwide and included Oregon, Washington, and California sources. 

1. Commercial landings, and length and weight data obtained from PacFIN, and the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW).
2. Estimates of commercial discard length frequencies and fraction discarded in the fishery obtained from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).
3. Recreational landings, discards, and length and weight data obtained from MRFSS and CRFS. 
4. Historical reconstruction of commercial and recreational landings from [@ralston_documentation_2010].
5. Fishery independent biological data (length, weight, and age) from the NWFSC WCGBTS survey.
6. Estimates of fecundity, maturity, and mortality from various sources.

A description of each data type is provided below, with timing of catch and composition data used in the base model shown in (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}).
