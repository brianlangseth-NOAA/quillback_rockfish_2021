# Introduction

## Basic Information

This assessment reports the status of quillback rockfish (*Sebastes maliger*) off the California coast using data through 2020. 

The stock off the California coast was assessed as a separate stock from other populations off the U.S. West Coast based on the fairly sedentary nature of quillback rockfish [@HannahandRankin_rockfish_site_fidelity_2011; @tolimieri_home_2009], which likely limits flow of fish between California and Oregon. Additionally, the exploitation history and magnitude of removals off the California coast differ from those in Oregon. Although the population of quillback rockfish in California is assessed statewide, given the range of quillback rockfish this assessment is primarily of quillback rockfish north of Point Conception. Catches of quillback rockfish south of Point Conception were rare, however where available these data were used within this assessment.      

<!-- Life history -->


## Life History

Quillback rockfish are a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from southern California to the Gulf of Alaska [@loveetal_2002]. Off the U.S. West Coast quillback rockfish are primarily located north of central California, with few observations south of Point Conception. Quillback rockfish have historically been part of both commercial and recreational fisheries throughout their range. 

Quillback rockfish are found in waters less than 274 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat [@loveetal_2002]. The diets of quillback rockfish consist primarily of benthic and pelagic crustaceans and fish [@Murie_diet_1995]. The body coloring of adult quillback rockfish is brown with yellow to orange blotching and light-colored dorsal saddle patches [@loveetal_2002]. As their name suggests, quillback rockfish have long dorsal fin spines.

Limited studies have evaluated genetic variation in quillback rockfish across the U.S. West Coast. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of quillback rockfish [@seeb_gene_1998; @Stoutetal_DPS_2001], however Seeb [-@seeb_gene_1998] did not find significant differentiation in populations of quillback rockfish between coastal Washington and Alaska. Significant population sub-division along the U.S. West Coast has been detected for the closely related, and more well-studied copper rockfish (*Sebastes caurinus*), indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations [@seeb_gene_1998; @buonaccorsi_population_2002; @johansson_influence_2008]. High site-fidelity [@HannahandRankin_rockfish_site_fidelity_2011] and relatively small home ranges [@tolimieri_home_2009] for quillback rockfish suggests similar patterns of isolation-by-distance as found for other rockfish.

Quillback rockfish are a long-lived rockfish estimated to live up to 95 years [@loveetal_2002; @YamanakaandLacko_rockfish_2001]. Quillback rockfish was determined to have a vulnerability (V = 2.22) of major concern in a productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011]. This analysis calculated species specific vulnerability scores based on two dimensions: productivity characterized by the life history, and susceptibility characterized by how the stock is likely affected by the fishery in question.


## Historical and Current Fishery Information

_Commercial_

Quillback rockfish off the coast of California is caught in both the recreational and commercial fisheries. Recreational removals are the largest source of fishing mortality over time and represent approximately 70 percent of the total removals of quillback rockfish across all years (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). The majority of the commerical landings for quillback rockfish ocurred between 1990 and 2009, and apart from a period in the late 1940s, in 1983, and in the last four years, commercial landings for quillback rockfish have been minimal. 

Prior to the development of the live-fish market in the 1980s, commercial catch of quillback rockfish was relatively low and quillback rockfish were often landed dead for a relatively low ex-vessel price per pound. Most fish were caught using hook and line gear, though some were caught using traps, gill nets and in some instances with trawl gear. Trawling within three miles of shore, where most of their habitat is found, has been prohibited since 1953 and gill nets were banned within three miles of shore in 1994. Whether from directed effort in the nearshore or as incidental catch while targeting other more valuable stocks such as lingcod, catches were below 0.5 mt from 1916 to 1980, with the exception of four years between 1944-1948.

With the development and expansion of the nearshore live-fish fishery during the late 1980s and early 1990s, new entrants in this open access fishery were drawn by premium ex-vessel price per pound for live fish resulting in over-capitalization of the fishery. Since 2002, the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has managed 19 nearshore species in accordance with Nearshore Fisheries Management Plan [@Wilson-Vandenbergetal_2014]. In 2003, the CDFW implemented a Nearshore Restricted Access Permit system, including requirement of a Deeper Nearshore Fishery Species Permit to retain quillback rockfish, with the overall goal of reducing the number of participants to a more sustainable level, with permit issuance based on historical landings history by a retrospective qualifying date. The result was a reduction in permits issued from 1,127 in 1999 to 505 in 2003, greatly reducing catch levels. In addition, reduced trip limits, season closures in March and April and depth restrictions were implemented to address bycatch of overfished species and associated constraints from these species low ACLs.
 
As overfished shelf rockfish have rebuilt, resumed access to deeper depths has been allowed for Nearshore Permit holders as well as open access fisheries. While deeper depth restrictions of 75 fm were implemented in 2019 south of Point Conception where yelloweye rockfish are uncommon, it still constrains accesss north of Point Conception where depth restrictions have been between 20 and 40 fm since 2003 depending on the management area. 

As open access fisheries allowed to retain shelf rockfish species co-occurring with nearshore rockfish species within the open depths, there is growing concern regarding increased encounters by non-permit holders and greater discard mortality from bycatch in deeper depths as discard mortality is 100% in depths greater than 30 fm. This is of particular concern considering increased trip limits for shelf rockfish species in combination with increased depth restrictions allowing access to these species, driving increased participation in the open access fishery exacerbating discard mortality. In addition, sampling rates for observers from the WCGOP on small vessels participating in these fisheries provide limited data to inform bycatch rates. Under National Standard 8, reduction of bycatch is a priority and increased observer rates would improve data on discards as the open access fishery for shelf rockfish expands.

_Recreational_

The California recreational fishery in the early part of the 1900s was focused on nearshore waters near ports, but expanded further from port and into deeper depths over time [@Milleretal_2014]. Prior to the rebuilding period for overfished species after the groundfish fishery was declared in 2000, there was access to all depths and year-round seasons for fishing groundfish. Access to deeper depths during this period spread effort over a larger area and filled bag limits with a greater diversity of species on the shelf as well as the nearshore. This resulted in lower catch rates for nearshore rockfish relative to the period after 2000 when depth restrictions between 20 to 50 fm were put in place in various management areas north of Point Conception where quillback rockfish are commonly found. This shift of effort onto the nearshore sustained catch levels for nearshore rockfish including quillback rockfish despite greatly reduced seasons as seen in (Figure \ref{fig:catch}). While the part of the stock that was available to the fishery in shallower depths was subject to higher fishing effort, the remainder occupying depths to 60 fm (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for estimates of density at depth based on remotely operated vehicle observations) was subject to reduced fishing effort due to more than a decade of 20 to 30 fm depth restrictions in place in the region to facilitate rebuilding of yelloweye rockfish. 

As the yelloweye rockfish stock continues to rebuild, incremental increases in access to deeper depths are expected to continue, increasing access to the remainder of the habitat for quillback rockfish. Once depth restrictions increase beyond 60 fm, effort for quillback rockfish may decrease as overall effort shifts to the shelf away from nearshore waters where quillback rockfish is most prevalent. It is also worth noting that Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) were instituted between 2003 and 2012 that now encompass 20-30% of the rocky reef habitat within 3 miles of shore in state waters along the coast (see [Appendix B](#append_b) for details), providing refugia to spawning stock in a network designed to seed areas outside the MPAs.

<!-- Summary of Management History and Performance -->


## Summary of Management History and Performance

Quillback rockfish is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Nearshore Rockfish North and Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South complexes are split at N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. off the U.S. West Coast. Each complex is managed based on a complex-level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL). The OFL and ACL values for the complexes are determined by summing the species specific OFLs and ACLs managed within each complex. Removals for species within each Nearshore complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

Quillback rockfish was most recently assessed in 2010 using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) to provide estimates of coastwide OFLs [@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]. The coastwide OFL was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat.. DB-SRA does not assess overfished status, but rather assumes that current depletion is distributed around the management target (e.g. 40%). The 2010 assessment found there was a 52% chance that quillback rockfish was experiencing overfishing, in that recent coastwide catch of quillback rockfish slightly exceeded the median coastwide OFL estimate. 

The current OFL contribution and implied ACL contribution for quillback rockfish South and North of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N., the state/specific ACL allocation (all of the South and 28.7% of the North contribution for California; Groundfish Management Team, pers. comm.), and the total removals are shown in Table \ref{tab:ofl}.

# Data
The following types and sources of data were used in this assessment. Fishery catch and composition data were specific to California, however biological data were estimated coastwide and included Oregon, Washington, and California sources. 

1. Commercial landings, and length and weight data obtained from PacFIN, and the CDFW.
2. Estimates of commercial discard length frequencies and fraction discarded in the fishery obtained from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).
3. Recreational landings, discards, and length and weight data obtained from the Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) and the California Recreational Fisheries Survey (CRFS; available on the Recreational Fisheries Information Network, RecFIN). 
4. Historical reconstruction of commercial and recreational landings from Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010].
5. Fishery independent biological data (length, weight, and age) from the Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC) West Coast Groundfish Bottom Trawl Survey (WCGBTS).
6. Estimates of fecundity, maturity, and mortality from various sources.

A description of each data type is provided below, with timing of catch and composition data used in the base model shown in (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}).

<!--chapter:end:20data.Rmd-->

## Fishery-Dependent Data

### Commercial Fishery

#### Landings

Commercial landings for quillback rockfish were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types and fish landed live vs. dead. The grouping of all commercial landings into a single fleet was driven by limited length composition data available per gear type, and that length distributions were similar by gear type among the data available. Additionally, commercial length data available in the Pacific Fisheries Information Network (PacFIN) database for California did not have the needed information to identify samples from live or dead fish (e.g., condition code) preventing the ability to evaluate the data based on live vs. dead landing. 

Commercial landings from 1916 - 1969 were queried from the Southwest Fisheries Science Center (SWFSC) catch reconstruction database for estimates from the California Catch Reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Landings in this database are divided into trawl, 'non-trawl', and 'unknown' gear categories, for various regions within California. During the 2016 catch reconstruction workshop it was realized that catches landed at California ports but caught off Oregon and Washington between 1948-1968 were not included in the Ralston et al. [-@ralston_documentation_2010] catch reconstructions. For rockfish species, a ratio estimator was calculated based on overall species composition from the most northern California area and applied to all rockfish market categories reported to be caught off Oregon and Washington. Catches of quillback rockfish were minimal and totaled approximately 0.30 mt over all years and were added to the landings from the catch reconstruction for this model.

In September 2005, the California Cooperative Groundfish Survey (CCGS) incorporated newly acquired commercial landings statistics from 1969 - 1979 into the CALCOM database. The data consisted of landing receipts ("fish tickets"), including mixed species categories for rockfish. In order to assign rockfish landings to individual species, the earliest available species composition samples were applied to the fish ticket data by port, gear, and quarter. These 'ratio estimator' landings are coded (internally) as market category 977 in the CALCOM database, and are used in this and past assessments as the best available landings for the time period 1969 - 1979 for all port complexes. Catches during this time for quillback rockfish are negligable. See Appendix A of Dick et al. [-@dick_status_2007] for further details.

Commercial fishery landings from 1984-2020 were pulled from the PacFIN (extracted 2/21/2021). There were no quillback rockfish catches in PacFIN from 1981-1984 so landings of quillback rockfish from 1981-1983 were set equal to the average landings from the three years before (1978 - 1980) and after (1984 - 1986) this time period. 

The input catches in the model represent total removals: landings plus discards (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Discards totals for the commercial fleet from 2002 - 2019 were determined based on WCGOP data provided in the Groundfish Expanded Mortality Multiyear (GEMM) product. The total coastwide observed discards were allocated to state and area based on the total observed landings observed by WCGOP. Discards were added to landings to obtain total removals for 2002-2019. Total removals prior to 2002, and for 2020 where no WCGOP data were yet available, were calculated using the average discard rates from WCGOP in 2002-2018 for California (3.6 percent).


#### Length Compositions 

Length data of quillback rockfish collected from commercial fisheries from 1978-2020 was extracted from PacFIN (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}, extracted 2/23/2021). Samples were very sparse prior to 1991 and consisted of only three samples, one each in 1978, 1984, and 1987, which were not used in model fitting (i.e. used as a 'ghost' fleet, not fit by the model but implied fits reflected in diagnostic output). Length samples were most numerous during the 1990s and since 2002 the number of length samples by year has been relatively low. The sizes observed from 1991 - 2002 were relatively broad, ranging from approximately 20 - 50 cm (the largest data bin; Figure \ref{fig:com-len-data}). Since approximately 2003 the range of sizes observed shrunk to around 30 - 45 cm and has tended toward larger sizes over time. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year which have gone from around 35 cm to above 40 cm since 2003 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-com-len-data}). The shift in mean size could be due to shifts in fishery behavior, sampling, changes in the population demographics (e.g., lack of strong recruitment), or a combination of multiple factors. 

The input sample sizes for the commercial length data were calculated via the Stewart method (Ian Stewart, personal communication) which incorporate the number of trips and fish by year:

\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $<$ 44

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}$ is $\geq$ 44

\end{centering}


### Recreational / Sport Fishery

#### Landings

Recreational landings from 1928 - 1980 were obtained from the historical reconstruction [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Recreational removals from 1981 - 1989 were obtained from MRFSS. The MRFSS dataset also includes removals in 1980 however landings from the historical reconstructions were preferred for 1980. Recreational removals from 1993 - 2020 were obtained from CRFS, downloaded from RecFIN. The total removals for the missing years between the MRFSS and CRFS datasets, 1990 - 1992, were assumed by applying a linear ramp in removals between the 1989 and 1993 values. Removals in 1993 were some of the largest for the recreational fleet across all years, so the effects of assuming an average catch from 1989 and 1994 for 19993 was explored as a Sensitivity (see Section \ref{sensitivity-analyses} for details). Both data sources, MRFSS and CRFS, provide total mortality which combined observed landings plus estimates of discarded fish. Discard estimates for the recreational fleet for years between 1928 - 1980 were calculated based on the discard rate (1.7 percent) from the MRFSS and CRFS data in years 1980-2004. A direct breakdown of the landed and discarded fish by weight was not available for these years, so the proportion by number of total dead catch that was unavailable to the sampler, which included dead discarded fish, was calculated and averaged across years.  

The recreational fishery is the main source of mortality for quillback rockfish in California (Table \ref{tab:allcatches} and Figure \ref{fig:catch}). Recreational removals peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, apart from two year of large catches in 1984 and 1993. Removals declined sharply in 1994, but increased in the mid 2000s and in recent years. 


#### Length Compositions 

Length data for retained catch observed by samplers for MRFSS (1980-2003) and CRFS (2004-2020) as well as lengths of discarded fish measured by samplers onboard CPFVs prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020 were downloaded from the RecFIN website.  

Recreational length samples from MRFSS for years 1980 - 2003 and from CRFS for years 2004 - 2020 were obtained from the RecFIN website, along with lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessels (CPFV) prior to being released (Type 3d data) from 2003 to 2020. The number of length observations by year are shown in Table \ref{tab:len-samps}, with the highest number of samples occuring in years since 2004. The distribution of lengths of quillback rockfish observed by the recreational fleet have generally ranged between 20 - 50 cm (the maximum length data bin size) across all available years (Figure \ref{fig:rec-len-data}). Samples in years prior to 1989 generally were more uniformly distributed and had smaller samples sizes than in other years. The mean length observed each year was more variable within and among years prior to the mid 1990s, ranging from slightly above 40 cm to slightly below 30 cm (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}). Since 2005, mean length has been less variable across years, between 35 and 40 cm, with less variation within a year.

The input sample sizes for the recreational length data were calculated equal to the number of length samples available by year. 

<!--chapter:end:21f-.Rmd-->

## Fishery-Independent Data

No fishery-independent data sources that are commonly incorporated in West Coast groundfish assessments (as required by the data moderate Terms of Reference) had adequate sample size of quillback rockfish off the California coast to include abundance indices for this assessment. The WCGBTS, the Hook and Line survey, and the Triennial survey collect data off the California coast on rockfish biology and abundance. There were no more than ten positive tows of quillback rockfish in any one year coastwide in the WCGBTS, but typically fewer than five. Similarly there were no more than five positive tows of quillback rockfish in any one year coastwide for the Triennial survey. No quillback rockfish were captured in the Hook and Line survey. Given indices of abundance were not calculated due to small sample sizes, length composition data from the WCGBTS (n = 91) and Triennial Survey (n = 42) off California were not included in the model. Biological data from the WCGBTS survey was used in external calculations of biological parameters, including growth and weight-at-length relationships. No ages or weights for quillback rockfish were available from the Triennial survey. 

<!--chapter:end:21s-.Rmd-->

<!-- Biological Data -->

## Biological Data

This assessment modeled quillback rockfish as a single sex. Growth and length-weight relationships were similar across sexes, and the literature provided limited evidence of sexual dimorphism in length [@LenarzandEcheverria_dimorphism_1991]. The sections below therefore describe combined male and female biological data. 

### Natural Mortality

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating instantaneous natural mortliaty rate ($M$) to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least-squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior suggested by Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]. The prior is defined as a log normal distribution with parameters $\mu = ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and $\sigma = 0.438$. Using a maximum age of 95 years, the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is 0.057 per year.

The maximum age assumed for calculating natural mortality in the base model was 95 years. The maximum age of 95 years was based on literature values for the U.S. West Coast examining the longevity of female quillback rockfish [@loveetal_2002; @Palssonetal_2009; @YamanakaandLacko_rockfish_2001]. Yamanaka and Lacko [-@YamanakaandLacko_rockfish_2001] found male longevity to be 76 years. Literature estimates were larger than the oldest aged quillback rockfish (73, 70, and 69) among data used in this assessment. These ages were from fish caught off the coast of Washington in 1999.

### Maturation and Fecundity

Maturity-at-length estimates were based on the work of Hannah and Blume [-@HannahandBlume_maturity_2011] which estimated the 50% size-at-maturity of 29.2 cm off the coast of Oregon with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}). A length at 50% maturity of 29.2 cm is consistent with other studies for quillback rockfish, which provide a range of 26-32 cm [@Echeverria_maturity_1987; @Rosenthaletal_maturity_1982].  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research by Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for quillback rockfish was estimated equal to 3.93e-07$L$^3.7^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.

### Length-Weight Relationship

The length-weight relationship for quillback rockfish was estimated outside the model using available coastwide biological data collected from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data sources (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-survey}). Sources included the WCGBTS, and recreational and commercial samples from all states (Table \ref{tab:len-at-weight-samps}). Only measured weight or length values were used; any values with more than two decimal places were assumed to be calculated from another measurement and were excluded. This occurred for 32 percent of lengths and 20 percent of the weights in the MRFSS-era recreational samples. Weights from Oregon special projects samples taken from the Oregon recreational and commercial fleets (n = 241) were not included. The estimated length-weight relationship for quillback rockfish was 1.963e-05$L$^3.02^ where $L$ is fork length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:len-weight}).

### Growth (Length-at-Age)

The length-at-age relationship for quillback rockfish was estimated outside the model using data collected from fishery-dependent sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington collected between 1998-2019, and from a single coastwide fishery-independent source (WCGBTS) collected between 2005-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}). Ages from Oregon special projects samples taken from the Oregon commercial fleet (n = 30) were not included. Age data were generally sparase for quillback rockfish from any one source (Figure \ref{fig:len-age-data}). The fishery-dependent data had limited observations of young fish less than 5 years of age, but had observations of fish up to 73 years of age. The fishery-independent data had limited observations of old fish greater than 40 years of age, but had observations of fish as young as one year of age. Growth parameters for quillback rockfish were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

$L_{\infty}$ = 43.04 cm; $k$ = 0.199; $t0$ = -0.067 cm  

\end{centering}

These values were fixed within the base model. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}. The estimate of $L_{\infty}$ is comparable to literature values, while the estimate of $k$ is on the higher side of literature values which vary from 0.06 - 0.19 [@YamanakaandLacko_rockfish_2001; @Palssonetal_2009; @Westetal_2014].

Table \ref{tab:growth-tab} shows the length-at-age, weight-at-age, maturity-at-age, and spawning output (the product of fecundity and maturity) assumed in the base model.

# Assessment Model

<!-- Summary of Previous Assessments and Bridging analysis -->


## Summary of Previous Assessments 

Quillback rockfish was last assessed in 2010 [@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]. The stock was assessed using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) which is a data-limited approach that incorporates catch data with priors on select parameters including natural mortality, the ratio of fishing mortality at maximum sustainable yield to natural mortality, current depletion, and the depletion at maximum sustainable yield to estimate overfishing status, but not overfished status. Quillback rockfish was assessed as a single coastwide stock to generate an overall OFL that was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N.. Assuming that current depletion was at the management target on average (e.g. 40%), the 2010 assessment found that quillback rockfish had a 52% chance of experiencing overfishing coastwide. 

### Bridging Analysis

A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured as a single coastwide model. The previous assessment also used DB-SRA, which uses different assumptions and data than the model used for this assessment, making a direct bridging analysis intractable.  

## Model Structure and Assumptions

California quillback rockfish was assessed using a one-sex model with life history parameters combined across sexes. The model assumed two fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in 1916. Selectivity for the commercial and recreational fleets was specified to be asymptotic using a six-parameter double normal parameterization. The ascending width and beginning size of maximum selectivity parameters were estimated. Annual recruitment deviations were estimated within the base model.

<!-- Modeling Platform and Structure and Priors-->


### Modeling Platform and Structure

Stock Synthesis (SS) version 3.30.16 was used to estimate the parameters in the model [@methot_stock_2013]. The R package r4ss, version 1.41.0 [@r4ss_2021], along with R version 4.0.2 [@R_2020] were used to investigate and plot model fits. The NWFSC developed R packages nwfscSurvey_2.0 and PacFIN.Utilities_0.0.2.0000 were used for synthesis and processing of data for use in Stock Synthesis. 

### Priors

Priors were used with fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model.  The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 95 years. The prior assumed a lognormal distribution for natural mortality with a median of 0.057 and a standard deviation of 0.48. 

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with mean of 0.72 and standard deviation of 0.158. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

### Data Weighting

Length composition data for the comercial fishery started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Section \ref{commercial-fishery} (Table \ref{tab:com-len-samps}). The input sample size for the recreational fishery length composition data was set equal to the number of length samples by year (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}). 

The base model was weighted using the McAllister-Ianelli method, which is based on equation 2.5 and 2.6 in Appendix 2 of McAllister et al. [-@mcallister_bayesian_1997]). The weightings applied using the McAllister-Ianelli method are provided in Table \ref{tab:dw}. This formulation accounts for a lack of independence in sampled fish by downweighting the number of samples. The amount of downweighting for a data set is calculated as the harmonic mean of the effective sample sizes across years. This method does not account for correlation in the data among years. Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in weighting using equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011] and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting (Thorson et al. [-@thorson_model-based_2017]).

### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 98 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 4 parameters for selectivity, 81 annual recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:params}). 

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, and natural mortality was fixed at 0.057, as described above in Section \ref{priors}. Growth, maturity-at-length, and length-at-weight were fixed as described above in Section \ref{biological-data}. The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at 0.6. Likelihood profiles were performed for steepness, natural mortality, length at maximum size, vonBertalanffy growth coefficient, and the CV at maximum length.

Selectivity in the recreational and commercial fleets was fixed to be asymptotic with only ascending width and beginning size of maximum selectivity being estimated. During initial model development, the descending width and width of maximum selectivity parameters for the recreational and commercial fleets were estimated to identify appropriate fixed values consistent with the data, and then fixed at those estimates. Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model as sensitivities (see [Sensitivity Analyses](#sensitivity-analyses) section). Older quillback rockfish are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. Dome shaped selectivity can also occur under hetergenous fishing pressure across space by fleets [@Waterhouseetal_spatialSelex_2014]. 

Given the depth closures in the recreational fishery off California it was initially assumed that large quillback rockfish would not be caught in the fishery indicating dome-shaped selectivity. However, lengths at depth of quillback rockfish from video lander data suggested larger quillback rockfish occur across depths nor are they limited to depths closed to fishing (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details). This information lead to the assumption of asymptotic selectivity for the recreational fleet for the base model.       

## Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for quillback rockfish was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of quillback rockfish off the California US West coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.

<!-- Base Model Results -->


## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}. 

### Parameter Estimates
Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The ln($R_0$) was estimated at 3.17. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic for the commercial fleet with a peak in maximum selectivity starting at 41.6 cm. The selectivity for the recreational fleet was also estimated to be asymptotic with a peak of the selectivity curve starting at 33.4 cm. Sensitivities to the shape of the commercial and recreational selectivity form and potential time blocking of the recreational fleet was explored (see below in Section \ref{sensitivity-analyses}).

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Strong recruitment events were estimated prior to 2000 and in 2011. Recruitment deviations in 1987, 1996, and 1999 were particularly strong and resulted in an increase in biomass during the early 2000s. While the largest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in these three specific years, the surrounding years in the 1980s and 1990s also have above average recruitment estimated. Recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s however were highly variable, with variation extending above the value of sigmaR (0.6), suggesting recruitment during these years is not strongly informed by the data. Recruitment deviations for 1996 and 1999 were less variable, with variance below that of sigmaR, suggesting these two years were more informed by the data. Below average recruitment was estimated in all years since 2000, with the exception of 2011. Bias adjustment was applied to the annual estimates of recruitment deviations following the pattern of increased bias adjust for recent years as shown within r4ss (Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}).

The general pattern in recruitment deviations showed fairly close coherence with the recruitment deviations estimated in the separate Oregon model. The Oregon base model estimated above average recruitment in the late 1990s, though for fewer years, and a strong recruitment pulse in 2012. This may potentially suggest that quillback rockfish off the coast of California and Oregon experience similar drivers in recruitment.

The large recruitment pulses in the 1980s and 1990s primarily show up in the composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets as a steady range of sizes across years, but also as a pulse of young fish around 2000 and 2001 for the commercial and recreational fleets. The recruitment pulse in 1999 does not clearly show up as a single pulse of young fish in later years but is probably aggregated with the 1996 recruitment pulse to support the trend of increasing mean size for both the commercial and recreational fleets. The increasing mean size in the recreational and commercial fleet after 2005 along with minimal catches of smaller fish in the compositional data supports the below average recruitment in the 2000s. The 2011 recruitment pulse shows up primarily in the composition data for the recreational fleet as pulses of smaller fish in 2015-2017 that are also reflected by declines in mean size. The commercial fleet also shows some pulses of smaller fish in 2017-2018 along with declines in mean size, with the later time frame likely being due to a right shifted selectivity curve compared to the recreational fleet. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. Fits to the length composition data by year are provided in [Appendix A](#append_a).

The Pearson residuals for the commercial fishery have no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data across cohorts but show areas of misfit over time (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The residuals show that the peak of the composition is being underfit in many years since 2001, where sample sizes are lower and the distributions have a prominant peak (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details). The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery were variable by year, with higher variation since 2004 given smaller sample size, and showed an increase in mean length starting in 2007 and a decline after 2014 (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). The increase in mean size estimated by the model was substantially less than the increase in mean size observed in the data, and likely a consequence of smaller sample size for commercial lengths compared to recreational lengths during this time.   

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data were variable by year and indicate no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). Positive residuals at the edges of the distribution in years before 2004 , which are the largest residuals, are indicative of widely spread distributions with lower sample size. In years since 2004, there are periods of positive and negative residuals in clusters over two to five years. The positive residuals indicate underfitting of peaked distributions (e.g. in 2006-2010, or in 2012-2014), whereas negative residuals indicate overfiting of the distribution as it skews to the left or right (e.g. 2005-2007 or 2015-2019; see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details). The mean length decreased from a high around 40cm in the early 1980s through the 1990s to under 30cm, and then increased slightly through 2004. After 2004, the variation in mean lenth was reduced, and mean leangth varied around 35cm, with increases through 2013 and decline in 2015 and 2016 (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The mean length was highly variable in 2002 due to low sample size (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}) and a flat length distribution. 

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregated lengths for both the commercial and recreational fleet well. Both fleets show similar ranges of sizes caught and a central tendency of 36 cm. The commercial fleet is more peaked compared to the recreational fleet, which has a more rounded peak around its central tendency and slight shift toward smaller sizes. The model expects a slightly higher proportion of the largest fish for both fleets relative to the data. This may indicate that the true selectivity of the recreational and commercial fleets may have some level of reduced selectivity for the largest fish (i.e. dome-shape). Sensitivities examining dome-shaped slectivity form were performed and presented in the [Sensitivity Analyses](#sensitivity-analyses) section below. 


### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output from the base model declines steadily until 1999, with the expection of a slight increase around 1990, and then increases due to several above average recruitment events that occurred in the to mid- to late-1990s. The population then increases until 2007 after which it remains level until 2016 and then declines through 2020. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the threshold of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (0.14, Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output ranges between approximately 5 - 25 percent of unfished equilibrium spawning output. The standard deviation of the log of the spawning output in 2020 is 0.39.

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at 0.72 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}. The estimated annual recruitment is shown in Figure \ref{fig:recruits}.

## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates and adjusting phases of the estimated parameters to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were first jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 64 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A lower negative log-likelihood model fit was not found. When parameters were jittered by 25 percent, 57 of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A lower negative log-likelihood model fit was again not found. Through the jittering done as explained and likelihood profiles (described below), we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability throughout initial model attempts and all explorations resulted in a positive-definite Hessian. 

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, natural mortality, $L_{\infty}$, growth coefficient ($k$), and CV at maximum length values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimating the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value. 

In regards to values of $R_0$, the negative log-likelihood was minimized at a ln($R_0$) of 3.17 (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). The commercial data supported lower ln($R_0$) values around 2.75 whereas the recreational data supported ln($R_0$) near the base model value. Increasing $R_0$ relative to the base model value resulted in an increase in stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 

For steepness, values at the upper bound of 1.0 had the lowest negative log-likelihood (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). Assuming higher or lower steepness values than the fixed base model value of 0.72 affected spawning output estimates by approximately 20% at most (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}), and had relatively little effects on stock status for all but the highest values (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}). The estimated relative final stock status was below 0.25 of unfished biomass for all but the highest value.

The negative log-likelihood profile across natural mortality supported values at the upper range of profiled values (0.12; Figure \ref{fig:m-profile}). The estimated stock trajectories assuming lower or higher natural mortality values than the base model value of 0.057 varied up to 20% of the unfished and recent spawning output (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb}). Higher values of $M$ reduced unfished spawning output but increased recent spawning output so the range of stock statuses varied widely from below the management precautionary zone (between 0.25 - 0.40) for lower values of $M$ to within and above the management precautionary zone for higher values of $M$ (Figure \ref{fig:m-depl}). 

A profile across a range of $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted. The negative log-likelihood was minimized at 42 cm, near the fixed value of 43.04, though the negative log-likelihood for both 41 cm and 43 were greater than two units from the minimum (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}). The commercial data supported lower $L_{\infty}$ values, at the edge of the profiled range. The stock scale varied across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in increased recent spawning output and assuming higher values resulted in incrased unfished spawning output but decreased recent spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb}). Lower values of $L_{\infty}$ compared to the base resulted in a range of stock status from within, and above the management precautionary zone whereas higher $L_{\infty}$ resulted in greater levels of depletion (Figure \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across values of $k$ showed support for values between 0.11 and 0.14, and was minimized at 0.13, which is lower than the fixed value of 0.199 (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile}). The commercial data suggested lower estimate of $k$ to minimize negative log-likelihood but supported estimates between 0.10 and 0.16 while the recreational data suggested a minimum at 0.19, but supported values ranging from 0.12 to 0.23. The stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:k-depl}) increased under lower $k$ values.

Profiles for $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ indicate there may be information in the data to estimate growth parameters given that well defined minimums for each parameter exist among the profile values. Sensitivities estimating growth were performed and presented in the [Sensitivity Analyses](#sensitivity-analyses) section below. 

The negative log-likelihood profile across values for the CV at maximum length showed support for 0.08 and 0.09, with a minimum at 0.08, slightly lower than the base model value of 0.1 (Figure \ref{fig:cv2-profile}). The commercial data supported 0.08 while the recreational data supported 0.09. Higher variation around maximum length (i.e. higher values of CV) resulted in smaller unfished and recent spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:cv2-ssb}), and greater depletion (Figure \ref{fig:cv2-depl}), though differences with the base model were relatively small across profiled values.   

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data up to 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The estimated spawning output (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb}) and stock status (Figure \ref{fig:retro-depl}) declined in comparison with the base model as recent years of data were removed. Removing years of data resulted in a steady decline is spawning output relative to the base model likely due to reducing the amount of information in the length comps about above average recruitment pulses (Figures \ref{fig:retro-recdevs}). 

### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Sensitivities were conducted as a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Deterministic recruitment from the stock recruitment curve. 

  \item Data weighting according to the Francis method (Francis DW) using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet Multinomial method (DM DW) where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 

  \item Estimate $L_{\infty}$.
  
  \item Estimate $k$.
  
  \item Estimate $L_{\infty}$ and $k$.

  \item Estimate the coefficient of variation in length of older fishes.

  \item Estimate natural mortality.
  
  \item Exclude composition data prior to 2004 for recreational fleet
  
  \item Exclude composition data prior to 1994 for recreational fleet

  \item Allow recreational selectivity form to be dome-shaped. 
  
  \item Allow commercial selectivity form to be dome-shaped.
  
  \item Estimate recreational selectivity block: 1979-1993 and 1994-2020 with asymptotic selectivity.  

  \item Adjust extreme catches for the commercial (in 1991) and recreational (in 1983 and 1993) fleets based on the average of the preceeding and following years. Ajusting recreational catches in 1993 results in changes to interpolated values in 1990-1992.     
  
\end{enumerate}

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}. Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning output, relative spawning output, and recruitment are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb}, \ref{fig:sens-depl}, and \ref{fig:sens-recdev}, respectively.

The largest change from the base model occurred where large catches were adjusted downward, and when estimating natural mortality. Estimating $M$ resulted in a 24 percent lower estimate for initial spawning output and over two-fold higher estimate for recent spawning output compared to the base model. Stock status increased to above the management target of 0.4. The estimate for $M$ was 0.11, which according to the prior of Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] would translate to a max age of around 50 years. Lowering the magnitude of large catches resulted in a 28 percent decline in unfished spawning output, but with a similar declien in recent spawning output such that stock status was similar. 

Six other sensitivities had either changes in initial spawning biomass near 10 percent or more, or resulted in depletion estimates within the management precaution zone (between 0.25 - 0.40). The sensitivities wehre recruitment deterministically followed the stock recruitment curve, and where data weighting was with the Dirichlet-Multinomial resulted in unfished spawning output increasing 10 percent, and declining 8 percent respectively, but similar stock status compared to the base model. Results for assuming deterministic recruitment were similar regardless of whether data weighting was updated. Estimating $L_{\infty}$, $k$, and $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ resulted in comparable estimates of unfished spawning output to that of the base model but higher recent spawning output. The two sensitivities estimating $k$ resulted in stock status between the target and threshold ratios, whereas the sensitivity estimating $L_{\infty}$ was slightly below 0.25 and more similar to the base model.  

All other sensitivities, including those estimating dome-shaped recruitment, resulted in similar estimates of unfished and recent spawning output, and thus had similar stock status, compared to the base model.

### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

A primary uncertainty for the California quillback rockfish model is in treatment of growth parameters. The fixed value for k for quillback rockfish is on the higher end of other published studies, ranging between 0.06-0.19, and results in a low $M$/$k$ ratio. Profiles and sensitivities for $L_{\infty}$ and $k$ suggest estimating these parameters is possible, both separately and together, and result in estimates of $k$ nearer to the middle of the range of literature values and estimates of $L_{\infty}$ near to the fixed value. The choice also matters in the sense that estimating growth parameters results in a different stock status compared to the base model. Despite well defined profiles for $k$ and $L_{\infty}$, we decided to keep the fixed values in the base model given the relatively limited length composition data, concerns over whether length data on its own can inform $k$, that the curve of estimated $k$ and $L_{\infty}$ values poorly fit the age and length data, and that growth estimates used in the model were based on data with young fish from the surveys to inform the estimate of $k$.

Variation in recruitment deviations remains an unresolved problem. Recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s were highly variable, and variance was higher than the assumed value for $sigmaR$. We explored numerous ways to account for this, with the only solution reducing recruitment deviations to below the value of $sigmaR$ was by reducing the variability in size at older ages to very small values (~0.01). Under such a scenario, the trajectory of the population was very similar to the base model as was the pattern of stronger than average recruitment deviations in the 1980s and 1990s followed by weaker than average recruitment deviations in the 2000s. Consequently, this remains an unresolved problem that does not appear to greatly affect model results.

Lastly, catches of quillback were particularly high in a few years for both the recreational and commercial fleets. Although not affecting estimates of depletion, averaging out these high years of catches affected model scale and therefore estimates of sustainable yield. Changes to catches affecting model scale is true of all models that assume catch is well known, however for quillback rockfish in California the magnitude of the reduction in catch for these years was approximately 20 percent of the total removals. Better understanding the factors contributing to these high catches as well as potential resolutions, should they be needed, would aid in ensuring catch time series and resulting estimates of sustainable yield are accurate.

# Management 

## Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (2020, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were 8.41 mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was 24.58 millions of eggs. 

The 2020 spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is below the threshold of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has been above the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in all years but four years from 1975-2009, and in all but three years since (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at 0.72.

## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying sigma and $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted ACLs for the southern management area and and the percent allocation (28.7 percent) for California in the northern management area provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT, personal communication). ACLs were apportioned to recreational and commercial catches based on the average proportion from 2018-2020 each fleet contributes to the total catch. 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels are to be determined later.

<!-- Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty -->


## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the 2021 spawning output is $\sigma$ = 0.39 and the uncertainty in the base model around the 2021 OFL is $\sigma$ = 0.37. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 2 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 1.0. 

## Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for quillback rockfish was limited by data.  Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

  \item At the time of the assessment due to issues in California data in PacFIN (i.e., condition code) length samples landed live vs. dead from the commercial were unable to be identified. The ability to examine sample sizes and lengths from each type of landings would allow for future assessments to account for a greater range of commercial fishing behavior.
  
  \item Improved understanding of where recreational fishing is commonly occuring (areas and depths) and the range of sizes available by depth would better inform the selectivity form, which currently is the near the shape for maturity.  

	\item Age data were predominantly from Oregon and Washington waters. Collecting length and otolith samples from recreational and commercial catches in California would result in samples from the entire U.S. West Coast informing growth.
	
	\item Recruitment patterns showed lower than average recruitment in the 2000s. Additional data to support such patterns in recruitment would provide additional support for model estimates. 
	
	\item Catches of quillback were particularly high in a few years for both the recreational and commercial fleet. Better understanding the factors contributing to these high catches as well as potential resolutions, should they be needed, would aid in ensuring catch time series are accurate.  
	
\end{itemize}

# Appendix

## Appendix A: California ROV Survey Data Informing Selectivity

From 2013-2015, the CDFW in collaboration with Marine Applied Research and Exploration (MARE), conducted ROV surveys along the full length of the California coastline inside marine protected areas and in reference sites outside for comparison. Density estimates were produced from the ratio of observed fish per unit area observed over the area of seafloor observed by the ROV in fish per meter squared. The percent relative density reflecting the proportion of the density observed in each depth bin was estimated relative to the sum of the density values in observed depths. A particular advantage of ROV data compared to other data sources is the accuracy of the depth of encounter of individual fish, providing useful information regarding selectivity of fishing gear relative to the depth distribution of animals observed by the ROV. Depth restrictions north of Point Conception varied from 20 to 40 fm for most of the last two decades. Densities were highest in the depths of 10 to 50 fm. Therefore, fish occur at depths greater than those that are open to fishing, indicating depth restrictions offer protection of quillback rockfish biomass (Table \ref{tab:ca-ROV}). 
 
In addition, length frequency distributions by depth were determined from fish observed by the ROV based on visual approximations using the distance between paired lasers. While future efforts to increase the precision of length estimates include using stereo-camera data and programs estimating length from trigonometric calculations, the trends in approximate length distribution with depth still provides useful information. The length frequency distribution by depth is provided in Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV}. In reviewing both the density by depth and length by depth relative to ontogenetic migration, the patterns may not reflect the smaller fish using shallow rocky reef as juveniles in less than 10 fm, and only reflect the density and composition in deeper depths where ontogenetic migration to deeper depths has already taken place for nearshore species and is not as apparent. 

When examining the length composition data by depth inside and outside of MPAs north of Point Conception (Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV}), no extreme differences in composition were observed, which is not surprising given the relatively recent implementation of MPAs north of Point Conception between 2007 and 2012. The MPAs make up 20-30% of the rocky reef habitat in state waters within three miles of shore ([Appendix B](#append_b)) and are intended to preserve the larger individuals as biomass accumulates in MPAs over time. 

The percentage of fish in 5 cm size categories among 10 fm depths bins north of Point Conception did not show clear signs of increasing size with depth in greater than 10 fm in either region or protected vs. reference sites (Figure \ref{fig:ca-ROV-percent}). This may be in part due to the fish having already moved from shallow kelp forest habitat where the ROV cannot operate to the adult depth distribution in greater than 10 fm by the time they are observed. Only in the shallower depth bins is there higher proportion of smaller individuals. This would indicate that selectivity may not be domed shaped as would be considered if the depth restrictions protecting a larger proportion of adult biomass.


## Appendix B: Percent Area Closed to Fishing in the RCA, CCA and MPAs over time

Marine protected areas were instituted at various times from 2003 to 2012 as the area selection process was undertaken on a regional process. The existence of no take MPAs in some of the areas selected prior to expansion of the MPAs to encompass approximately 20-30% of rocky reef habitat in state waters, duration of existence of new areas, degree of effort prior to protection or criteria for selection including productivity of the reef may have contributed to the current patterns in composition and density inside vs. outside MPAs. As biomass accrues inside MPAs, accounting for protections through area-based assessment methods or effects on selectivity should be considered as fishery dependent data will only reflect the length composition and density outside the MPAs. 
 
The percentage area closed to fishing in MPAs, RCAs and CCAs from 2001 to 2021 are shown for each in Table \ref{tab:ca-mpa}.  The percentage closed to fishing provides a buffer against uncertainty through protection of a portion of the population. The percent area in MPAs prohibiting take by the recreational and commercial fisheries were included in the estimates of area closed to fishing from the first year in which the MPA was in place for a full calendar year. Areas closed to fishing prior to the implementation of the present MPA network were also accounted for. The CCA area accounted for waters around islands where take was allowed for a limited suite of species including nearshore rockfish and lingcod in depths around the islands. The RCAs for commercial and recreational fisheries were based on the deeper of the depth restrictions for the sectors to reflect only areas where take was prohibited for both. Where the RCA lines for the stock in question were not available, depth contours were used to approximate the percent of area closed, denoted by an asterisk.  The presence of each type of closures in each assessment region and year was converted to tables of Boolean fields allowing GIS algorithms estimating the area open and closed to fishing. The distribution and area of rocky reef habitat was determined using the GIS layers rendering the results of the side scanning sonar from the California Seafloor Mapping Project to identify hard bottom at varying levels of resolution from two square meters to ten meters based on the depth surveyed due to cone width of the sonar. The area of rocky reef habitat closed to fishing within the depth distribution of the focal species was converted to a percentage of the total habitat.
