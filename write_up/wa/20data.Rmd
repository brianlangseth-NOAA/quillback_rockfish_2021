# Data
The following types and sources of data were used in this assessment. Fishery catch and composition data were specific to `r state`, however biological data were estimated coastwide and included Oregon, Washington, and California sources. 

1. Commercial landings, and length, weight, and age data obtained from PacFIN and the Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife (WDFW). Age compositions were not fit in the model. 
2. Estimates of commercial discard length frequencies and fraction discarded in the fishery obtained from the West Coast Groundfish Observer Program (WCGOP).
3. Recreational landings, discards, and length, weight, and age data obtained from RecFIN and the WDFW. Age compositions were not fit in the model.
4. Fishery independent biological data (length, weight, and age) from the NWFSC WCGBTS survey.
5. Estimates of fecundity, maturity, and mortality from various sources.

A description of each data type is provided below, with timing of catch and composition data used in the base model shown in (Figure \ref{fig:data-plot}).

[are commercial data really from PacFIN or should I be more precise? Similarly, are recreational data really from RecFIN or should I say ORBS and MRFSS?]
