## Model Diagnostics

### Convergence

Proper convergence was determined by starting the minimization process from dispersed values of the maximum likelihood estimates and adjusting phases of the estimated parameters to determine if the model found a better minimum. Starting parameters were jittered by 10 percent. This was repeated 100 times with 19 out of 100 runs returned to the base model likelihood. A better, lower negative log-likelihood, model fit was not found. Through the jittering done as explained, likelihood profiles, and alternative phasing, we are confident that the base model as presented represents the best fit to the data given the assumptions made. There were no difficulties in inverting the Hessian to obtain estimates of variability throughout initial model attempts and all explorations resulted in a positive-definite Hessian.

### Likelihood Profiles

Likelihood profiles were conducted for $R_0$, steepness, natural mortality, $L_{\infty}$, and growth coefficient ($k$) values separately. These likelihood profiles were conducted by fixing the parameter at specific values and estimating the remaining parameters based on the fixed parameter value. 

In regards to values of $R_0$, values from approximately 1.8 to 4 were supported with the negative log-likelihood minimized at approximately a log($R_0$) of `r round(log(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == "Recr_Virgin",2]),2)` (Figure \ref{fig:r0-profile}). This suggests the data contain limited information on the scale of the population. Increasing the $R_0$, relative to the value estimated results in an increase in stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:r0-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:r0-depl}). 
Similar to results for $R_0$ results from the profile on steepness suggest the data have limited information on the value of steepness. Any value of steepness was supported based on change in log-likelihood, with the lowest negative log-likelihood occurring near the value for the base model of `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep",3],2)` (Figure \ref{fig:h-profile}). 

[need to finish below - really odd profile]
[Assuming higher or lower steepness values had little impact on the recent unfished and spawning output estimated for all but the lowest values (Figure \ref{fig:h-ssb}). The estimated relative final stock status was above 0.40 of unfished biomass across steepness values except for the lowest values (0.30 and 0.40) (Figure \ref{fig:h-depl}).]

The negative log-likelihood profile across natural mortality supported the largest values in the profile. The estimated stock trajectories assuming lower or higher natural mortality values impacted the estimated unfished spawning output (Figures \ref{fig:m-ssb}) but resulted in generally similar stock statuses near to or above the management target (Figures \ref{fig:m-depl}).

A profile across a range of $L_{\infty}$ values was also conducted and values from approximately 40 to 44 cm were supported with a minimum around 41 cm (Figure \ref{fig:linf-profile}). The value of $L_{\infty}$ in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1","Value"]`.The stock scale and status is quite variable across alternative $L_{\infty}$ values where assuming lower values resulted in sharp increases in stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:linf-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:linf-depl}).

The negative log-likelihood profile across values of $k$ supported all values within the profile but was minimized at lower values of $k$ (Figure \ref{fig:k-profile}). The $k$ value for fish in the model was fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1","Value"]`. The stock scale (Figure \ref{fig:k-ssb}) and status (Figure \ref{fig:k-depl}) increased under lower $k$ values but the chang was small compared to changes caused by other parameters.

### Retrospective Analysis

A five-year retrospective analysis was conducted by running the model using data up to 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019. The estimated spawning output was consistent with the base model when recent year's data were removed up until 4 and 5 years of data were removed (Figures \ref{fig:retro-ssb} and \ref{fig:retro-depl}). Remove 4 and 5 years of data resulted in a downward shift in stock scale and status. 

### Sensitivity Analyses

A number of sensitivity analyses were conducted. Sensitivities were conducted as a single exploration from the base model assumptions and/or data, and were not performed in a cumulative fashion.

\begin{enumerate}
   
  \item Estimate annual recruitment deviations. 

  \item Data weighting according to the McAllister-Ianelli method (MI DW) using the weighting values shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 
  
  \item Data weighting according to the Dirichlet Multinomial method (DM DW) where the estimated parameters are shown in Table \ref{tab:dw}. 

  \item Estimate $L_{\infty}$.

  \item Estimate the coefficient of variation in length of older fishes.

  \item Estimate natural mortality ($M$).
  
  \item Exclude composition data prior to 1995 for the recreational fleet.
  
  \item Exclude fitting to commercial length data. Set the selectivity of the commercial fleet to equal that of the recreational fleet.
  
  \item Fix recreational selectivity form to be dome-shaped while also estimating annual recruitment deviations. 
  
  \item Fix commercial selectivity form to be dome-shaped.

  \item Estimate a recreational selectivity block from 1958-1999, and 2000-2020.   
  
\end{enumerate}

Sensitivity runs estimating $k$ and estimating a dome-shaped selectivity form for the recreational fishery were also conducted but resulted in the model failing to estimate a reasonable biomass scale (near the upper bound of log($R_0$) of 20). 

Likelihood values and estimates of key parameters from each sensitivity are available in Table \ref{tab:sensitivities}. Plots of the estimated time-series of spawning biomass and relative spawning biomass are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}. There was high uncertainty in estimates of $R_0$ for the sensitivities estimating $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in length of older fishes and therefore plots were made without these two sensitivites and are shown in Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-subset} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-subset}.

The two sensitivities that had the largest impact relative to the base model were the ones that estimated $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in length of older fishes (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb} and \ref{fig:sens-depl}). These two sensitivities estimated log(R0) 50 and 75 percent larger than the base model despite estimating a change in $L_{\infty}$ of 2 cm (from `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1","Value"]`), and change in the coefficient of variation in length of older fishes to around 7 percent (from 10 percent).

The next two sensitivities that had the largest impact on biomass scale relative to the base model were the sensitivities exploring data weighting using the DM Method, which resulted in a larger biomass scale than the base model, and the sensitivity estimating natural mortality, which resulted in a smaller biomass scale than the base model (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-subset} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-subset}). Despite the differences in scale, both sensitivities resulted in higher stock status than the base model. Estimating natural mortality resulted in a tradeoff with selectivity. When allowing flexibility in $M$, the model estimates a high value than the base case, which results in higher estimates for the peak size in selectivity for both fleets. The estimate of $M$ is therefore limited by the parameter estimates for the peak in selectivity approaching their bounds. 

The sensitivity estimating annual recruitment deviations resulted in a lower biomass scale, and level of depletion such that spawning ouput in `r endyr` was below the threshold of 25 percent of unfished spawning output (Figures \ref{fig:sens-ssb-subset} and \ref{fig:sens-depl-subset}). The estimates or recruitment deviations had a period of above-average recruitment from 1987 to 2003, then switched to a period of low recruitment (Figure \ref{fig:sens-recdev}). The recruitment deviation estimates were likely being driven by smaller lengths observed in the recreational fleet in the mid 1990s, but mostly by a lack of smaller fish being caught since 2000 (Figure \ref{fig:mean-rec-len-data}). Furthermore, the variability of the recruitment deviations up to around 2005 were higher than the assumed variability in recruitment (0.6), suggesting the increased recruitments were not well informed by the data. The pattern of recruitment deviations estimated seemed extreme for the `r state` model but the general pattern showed some coherence with the recruitment deviations estimated in the separate Oregon model. The Oregon base model estimated above average recruitment in the late 1990s which led to an increase in spawning output during the 2000s. This may potentially suggest that `r spp` off the coast of Oregon and Washington experience similar drivers in recruitment, howeer, the Oregon model estimated periods of higher recruitment since 2000 to support increasing catches over time and also to fit pulses of small fish in the length data, whereas the `r state` base model estimates lower than average recruitment throughout that time period.   


### Unresolved Problems and Major Uncertainties

The primary uncertainty for the `r state` `r spp` model is in the scale of the population. The trajectory of the population is generally consistent across profiles and sensitivities however the scale of the population is poorly informed by data. This is evident in the relatively wide uncertainty in the estimate of $R_0$, leading to uncertainty around spawning biomass and around stock status. Estimating growth parameters, notably $L_{\infty}$ and the coefficient of variation in length of older fish affected the population scale greatly. Estimating recruitment deviations also reduced the scale of the population, and also resulted in spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output falling below the threshold value. Profiles across fixed parameters show support across a wide range of values based on negative log-likelihood and also result in large changes in stock size and status. Consequently, this base model is dependent on many of the assumptions in parameter values. 

More information on the perceived lack of small fish in the recreational fishery would improve understanding if indeed this is due ot recruitment or sampling issues or steady and ongoing changes in the fishery. An increase in smaller fish in 2020 may indicate a recruitment event, however more years of data would be needed to confirm.
