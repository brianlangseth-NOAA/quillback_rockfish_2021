## Biological Data

This assessment modeled `r spp` as a single sex. Data available were generally sparse, growth and length-weight relationships were similar across sexes, and the literature provided limited evidence of sexual dimorphism in length [@LenarzandEcheverria_dimorphism_1991]. The sections below therefore describe combined male and female biological data. 

### Natural Mortality

Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] developed a method for combining meta-analytic approaches relating instantaneous natural mortliaty rate ($M$) to other life-history parameters such as longevity, size, growth rate, and reproductive effort to provide a prior on $M$. Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] provided an updated data set of estimates of $M$ and related life history parameters across a large number of fish species from which to develop an $M$ estimator for fish species in general. They concluded by recommending $M$ estimates be based on maximum age alone, based on an updated Hoenig non-linear least-squares estimator $M=4.899A^{-0.916}_{max}$. The approach of basing $M$ priors on maximum age alone was one that was already being used for West Coast rockfish assessments. However, in fitting the alternative model forms relating $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$, Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] did not consistently apply their transformation. In particular, in real space, one would expect substantial heteroscedasticity in both the observation and process error associated with the observed relationship of $M$ to $A_{\text{max}}$. Therefore, it would be reasonable to fit all models under a log transformation. This was not done. Re-evaluating the data used in Then et al. [-@then_evaluating_2015-1] by fitting the one-parameter $A_{\text{max}}$ model under a log-log transformation (such that the slope is forced to be -1 in the transformed space Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]), the point estimate for $M$ is:

\begin{centering}

$M=\frac{5.4}{A_{\text{max}}}$

\end{centering}

The above is also the median of the prior suggested by Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015]. The prior is defined as a log normal distribution with parameters $\mu = ln(5.4/A_{\text{max}})$ and $\sigma = 0.438$. Using a maximum age of `r model$accuage` years, the point estimate and median of the prior for $M$ is `r model$parameters["NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"]` per year.

The maximum age was selected based on literature values for the U.S. West Coast examining the longevity of `r spp` [@loveetal_2002; @Palssonetal_1999; @Yamanaka_and_Lacko_2001]. The oldest aged `r spp` among available data used in the assessment was 70 years with two observations off the coast of Washington in 1999.   


### Maturation and Fecundity
Maturity-at-length estimates were based on the work of Hannah and Blume [-@Quillback_maturity_2011] which estimated the 50% size-at-maturity of `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1], 1)` cm and slope of `r round(model$MGparmAdj$Mat_slope_Fem_GP_1[1], 2)` off the coast of Oregon with maturity asymptoting to 1.0 for larger fish (Figure \ref{fig:maturity}). A length at 50% maturity of `r round(model$MGparmAdj[,"Mat50%_Fem_GP_1"][1], 1)` cm is consistent with other studies for `r spp`, which range 26-32 cm (see Jason's life history matrix).  

The fecundity-at-length was based on research by Dick et al. [-@dick_meta-analysis_2017]. The fecundity relationship for `r spp` was estimated equal to `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_scalar_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Eggs_exp_len_Fem[1],2)`^ in millions of eggs where $L$ is fork length in cm. Fecundity-at-length is shown in Figure \ref{fig:fecundity}.


### Sex Ratio
Given the base model was of combined sexes, the sex ratio was assumed to be 1:1.

### Length-Weight Relationship
The length-weight relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using available coastwide biological data collected from fishery-independent and fishery-dependent data sources (Figure \ref{fig:len-weight-survey}). Sources included the WCGBT and Triennial Surveys, and recreational and commercial samples from all states. Only measured weight or length values were used; any values with more than two decimal places were assumed to be calculated from another measurement and were excluded. This occurred for 32 percent of lengths and 20 percent of the weights in the MRFSS-era recreational samples. The estimated length-weight relationship for `r spp` was `r format(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_1_Fem[1], scientific = TRUE)`$L$^`r round(model$MGparmAdj$Wtlen_2_Fem[1],2)`^ where $L$ is fork length in cm (Figures \ref{fig:len-weight}).


### Growth (Length-at-Age)
The length-at-age relationship for `r spp` was estimated outside the model using data collected from fishery-dependent sources off the coast of Oregon and Washington collected between 1998-2019, and from a single coastwide fishery-independent sources (WCGBT Survey) collected between 2005-2019 (Table \ref{tab:len-at-age-samps}).  Age data was generally sparase for `r spp` from any one source. The fishery-dependent data had limited observations of young fish less than 5 years of age, but had observations of fish up to 73 years of age, and the fishery-independent data had limited observations of old fish greater than 40 years of age, but had observations of fish as young as one year of age. Growth parameters for `r spp` were estimated at the following values:

\begin{centering}

$L_{\infty}$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$L_at_Amax_Fem_GP_1[1], 1)` cm; $k$ = `r round(model$MGparmAdj$VonBert_K_Fem_GP_1[1], 3)`

\end{centering}

These values were fixed within the base model. The coefficient of variation (CV) around young and old fish was fixed at a value of 0.10 for both sexes. The length-at-age curve with the CV around length-at-age is shown in Figure \ref{fig:len-age-ss}.  
  
  
### Ageing Precision and Bias
Ages were not fit in the model.
