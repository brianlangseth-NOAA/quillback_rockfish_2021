### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` millions of eggs. 

The `r endyr+1` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has been above the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in nearly all years from 1977-2001, and in all but 2015 and 2016 since 2011 (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Figure \ref{fig:phase-plot} shows the phase plot of relative spawning output and fishing intensity. Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.


## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model was estimated for years 2023-2032, with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying sigma and $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the combined total mortality from commercial and recreational fleets averaged from 2017-2020 as requested by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT, personal communication). The removals were apportioned to recreational and commercial catches based on the average proportion from 2018-2020 that each fleet contributed to the total catch. 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels are to be determined later.

# Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data.  Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Continue collecting length and otolith samples from recreational and commercial catches, as well as from surveys, which capture small `r spp`.

	\item Improved understanding of where recreational fishing is commonly occurring (areas and depths) and the range of sizes available by depth would be beneficial to better inform the selectivity form.  
	
	\item Recruitment patterns showed lower than average recruitment in the 2000s. Additional data to support such patterns in recruitment would provide additional support for model estimates.  
	
\end{itemize}
