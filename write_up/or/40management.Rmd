## Harvest Projections and Decision Tables

A ten year projection of the base model with catches equal to the estimated Acceptable Biological Catch (ABC) based on the category 2 time-varying sigma and $P^*$ = 0.45 for years 2023-2032 (Table \ref{tab:project}). The removals in 2021 and 2022 were set based on the adopted Annual Catch Limits (ACLs) and the percent allocation (58.4 percent) for Oregon provided by the PFMC Groundfish Management Team (GMT, personal communication). ACLs were apportioned to recreational and commercial catches based on the average proportion from 2018-2020 each fleet contributes to the total catch. 

The decision table uncertainty axes and catch levels are to be determined later.

## Evaluation of Scientific Uncertainty

The estimated uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` spawning output is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$Pstar_sigma,2)` and the uncertainty in the base model around the `r endyr + 1` OFL is $\sigma$ = `r round(model$OFL_sigma,2)`. The estimated model uncertainty was less than the category 2 groundfish data moderate assessment default value of  $\sigma$ = 1.0. 


# Research and Data Needs

The ability to estimate additional process and biological parameters for `r spp` was limited by data.  Collecting the following data would be beneficial to future assessments of the stock:

\begin{itemize}

	\item Continue collecting length and otolith samples from recreational and commercial catches, as well as from surveys, which capture small `r spp`.

	\item Improved understanding of where recreational fishing is commonly occuring (areas and depths) and the range of sizes available by depth would be beneficial to better inform the selectivity form.  
	
	\item Recruitment patterns showed lower than average recruitment in the 2000s. Additional evidence in the data showing such patterns in recruitment would provide additional support for model estimates.  
	
	\item The presence of `r spp` in standard fishery-independent surveys was too sparse to include as indices of abundance. Fishery-independnt surveys specific to quillback rockfish would help with understanding population trends. 
	
\end{itemize}

## Comparisons with state-based fishery-independent surveys 

Fishery-independent surveys along the Oregon coast have been conducted by the ODFW.
