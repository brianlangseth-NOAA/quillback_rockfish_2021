## Fishery-Independent Data

No fishery-independent data sources that are commonly incorporated in West Coast groundfish assessments (as required by the data moderate Terms of Reference) had adequate sample size of `r spp` off the Oregon coast to include abundance indices for this assessment. The WCGBTS, and historically the Triennial survey, collect data off the Oregon Coast on rockfish biology and abundance. There were no more than ten positive tows of `r spp` in any one year coastwide in the WCGBTS, but typically fewer than five. Similarly there were no more than five positive tows of `r spp` in any one year coastwide for the Triennial survey. Biological data from the WCGBTS surveys were used in external calculations of biological parameters. No ages or weights for 'r spp' were available from the Triennial survey. 

Oregon has a number of state-specific small-scale fishery-independent surveys considered by ODFW to have adequate samples of `r spp`. These include....Given these surveys are not commonly incorporated into West Coat groundfish assessments, and are not explicitly conducted as a state-wide estimate of relative or absolute abundance, we do not include the data in the model for `r spp`. However, we do compare estimates from these surveys to the our assessment model in Section \ref{Unresolved-Problems-and-Major-Uncertainties}.
