## Base Model Results

The base model parameter estimates along with approximate asymptotic standard errors are shown in Table \ref{tab:params} and the likelihood components are shown in Table \ref{tab:likes}. Estimates of derived reference points and approximate 95 percent asymptotic confidence intervals are shown in Table \ref{tab:referenceES}. Estimates of stock size and status over time are shown in Table \ref{tab:timeseries}.

### Parameter Estimates

Estimated parameter values are provided in Table \ref{tab:params}. The $R_0$ was estimated at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'SR_LN(R0)', 'Value'], 2)`. The selectivity curves for the commercial and recreational fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:selex}. The selectivity was fixed to be asymptotic for the commercial fleet with a peak in maximum selectivity for fish starting at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_OR_Commercial(1)', 'Value'], 1)` cm. The selectivity for the recreational fleet was estimated to be dome-shaped at the largest sizes. The peak of the selectivity curve by the recreational fleet was estimated to start at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == 'Size_DblN_peak_OR_Recreational(2)', 'Value'], 1)` cm and decline at 43 cm. Sensitivities to the shape and potential time blocking of the recreational selectivity was explored (see below in Section \ref{sensitivity-analyses}). After discussions with individuals knowledgable about the recreational fishery, we theorized that the limited dome-shape in selectivity could arise due to

The estimated annual recruitment and recruitment deviations are shown in Figures \ref{fig:recruits} and \ref{fig:rec-devs}. Strong recruitment events were estimated to have occurred in 1993, 1995, 1999, and 2012 which resulted in a substantial increase in biomass during the late 1990s and early to mid 2000s. While the largest recruitment deviations were estimated to have occurred in these four specific years, the surrounding years in the 1990s also have above average recruitment estimated, whereas the surrounding years in the 2000s have lower than average recruitment estimated. Bias adjustment was applied to the annual estimates of recruitment deviations following the pattern of increased bias adjust for recent years as shown within r4ss (Figure \ref{fig:bias-adj}).

The large recruitment pulses in the 1990s show up in the composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets in some years as a pulse of young fish, but more so as a steady increasing trend in mean size that help contribute to the increasing catches over the time given the estimates of population size. The steadily increasing mean size in the recreational fleet along with minimal catches of smaller fish in the compositional data supports the below average recruitment in the 2000s, until 2012. The 2012 large recruitment pulses show up in the composition data for both the commercial and recreational fleets as pulses of smaller fish that are also reflected by declines in mean size. 

### Fits to the Data

Fits to the length data are shown based on the Pearson residuals-at-length, the annual mean lengths, and aggregated length composition data for the commercial and recreational fleets. The Person residuals for the commercial fishery have no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data across cohorts but show areas of misfit over time (Figure \ref{fig:com-pearson}). The residuals show that the peak of the composition is being underfit for many years. These years have lower sample size, and for years with high sample size such as 2000, 2002, and 2017, compositions are being fit well. The largest residuals were observed in 1999 or when missing small spikes of small fish in the compositions (2009, 2017, 2020) (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details). The mean lengths observed by the commercial fishery were variable by year but with generally consistent confidence intervals across years and showed an increase in mean length followed by a period of stability and then decline (Figure \ref{fig:com-mean-len-fit}). 

The Pearson residuals for the recreational length data were variable by year and have no discernible pattern of misfit to the length data (Figure \ref{fig:rec-pearson}). A period of positive residuals from 2005-2014 show that the peak of the composition is being underfit, however looking at the fits suggest overall good fit (see [Appendix A](#append_a) for details). The residual patterns for 2017-2020, which are the largest residuals outside misfit of very high and very low lengths in low sample size years (before 1990), show the model has difficulty fitting the bimodal patterns in these years, which are not unexpected. Throughout the mid-2000s the mean length increases to a larger size (around 40 cm in 2015) with a substantial decrease in variation of the observed lengths compared to pre-2000 lengths (Figure \ref{fig:rec-mean-len-fit}). The mean length was highly variable in 2015 due to low sample size (Table \ref{tab:len-samps}) 

Aggregate fits by fleet are shown in Figure \ref{fig:agg-len-fit}. The model fits the aggregated lengths for the recreational fleet well. The fit to the commercial fleet is poorer. Both fleets show similar ranges of sizes caught and an aggregated peak around 40 cm. The commercial fleet shows proportionally less catch of intermediate size fish between 30-40 cm compared to the recreational fleet. The model overfits the proportion of intermediate fish in the commercial fishery and underestimates the proprotion of fish selected at their peak. Additional explorations with selectivity blocks for the commercial fleet did not greatly improve the aggregate fit. 

[The poor fit to the commerical aggregate lengths was further explored by applying selectivity blocks to the commercial fleet, but fits to the aggregate fits generally remained unchanged. The differences on overall model results were small, and with lack of clear evidence for blocks within the commercial fleet, and added complexity with applying blocks, we chose to not include in the base model]
[explain the pattern from comercial gear does not appear to be due to differences in gear - its common across most gears]

### Population Trajectory

The predicted spawning output (in millions of eggs) is given in Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and plotted in Figure \ref{fig:ssb}. The predicted spawning output from the base model declines until 1995, and steadies due to several above average recruitment events that occurred in the early- to mid-1990s. The population then increases dramatically in the early 2000s due to the very large recruitment event in 1995. The population increase slows in the late 2000s, and then declines in the 2010s due to below average recruitment through the 2000s. The estimate of total biomass over time is shown in Figure \ref{fig:tot-bio}.

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (`r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Bratio_2021','Value'], 2)`, Figure \ref{fig:depl}). Approximate confidence intervals based on the asymptotic variance estimates show that the uncertainty in the estimated spawning output is large ranging between approximately 20 - 75 percent of unfished equilibrium spawning output. 

The slight dome shape in the final selectivity for the recreational fleet results in a fraction of large fish being unavailable in recent years (Figure \ref{fig:unavail-bio}). The fraction of large fish unavailable averaged five percent of the overall biomass since 1970, and in theory would be available for selection from the commercial fishery.  

The stock-recruit curve resulting from a value of steepness fixed at `r print(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)` is shown in Figure \ref{fig:bh-curve}.

### Reference Points

Reference points were calculated using the estimated selectivity and catch distributions among fleets in the most recent year of the model (`r endyr`, Table \ref{tab:referenceES}). Sustainable total yields  were `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'Dead_Catch_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` mt when using an $SPR_{50\%}$ reference harvest rate. The spawning output equivalent to 40 percent of the unfished spawning output ($SB_{40\%}$) was `r round(model$derived_quants[model$derived_quants$Label == 'SSB_SPR', 'Value'], 2)` millions of eggs. 

The `r endyr` spawning output relative to unfished equilibrium spawning output is above the target of 40 percent of unfished spawning output (Figure \ref{fig:depl}). The fishing intensity, $1-SPR$, has been above the harvest rate limit ($SPR_{50\%}$) in nearly all years from 1977-2001, and in all but 2015 and 2016 since 2011 (Table \ref{tab:timeseries} and Figure \ref{fig:1-spr}). Table \ref{tab:referenceES} shows the full suite of estimated reference points for the base model and Figure \ref{fig:yield} shows the equilibrium curve based on a steepness value fixed at `r model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"]`.
