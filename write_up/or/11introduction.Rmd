# Introduction

## Basic Information

This assessment reports the status of `r spp` (*`r spp_latin`*) off the `r coast` Coast using data through `r endyr`. `r Spp` is a medium- to large-sized nearshore rockfish found from California to the Gulf of Alaska [@loveetal_2002]. Off the U.S. West Coast `r spp` are primarily located north of central California, with rare observations south of Point Conception. 


## Life History

`r Spp` are found in waters less than 274 meters in depth in nearshore kelp forests and rocky habitat [@loveetal_2002]. The diets of `r spp` consist primarily of crustaceans, mollusks, and fish [@lea_biological_1999; @bizzarro_diet_2017-1]. The body coloring or `r spp` varies across the coast with northern fish often exhibiting dark brown to olive  with southern fish exhibiting yellow to olive-pink variations in color [@miller_guide_1972] which initially led to them being designated as two separate species (*S. caurinus* and *S. vexillaris*). 

Limited studies have been performed looking for genetic variation in `r spp` across the U.S. West Coast. Genetic work has revealed significant differences between Puget Sound and coastal stocks of `r spp` [@Seeb_geneflow_1998; @Stout_et_al_2001], however [@Seeb_geneflow_1998] did not find significant differentiation in populations of `r spp` between Washington and Alaska when Puget Sound samples were excluded. Significant population sub-division along the U.S. West Coast has been detected for the similar, and more well-studied copper rockfish (*Sebastes caurinus*), indicating limited oceanographic exchange among geographically proximate locations [@Seeb_geneflow_1998; @buonaccorsi_population_2002; @johansson_influence_2008]. High site-fidelity [@HannahandRankin_rockfish_site_fidelity_2011] and relatively small home ranges [@Tolimierietal_rockfish_home_range_2009] for `r spp` would suggest similar patterns of isolation-by-distance as found for other rockfish.

Talk about sexual dimorphism not very present. 

`r Spp` are a long-lived rockfish and estimated to live at least 90 years [@love_milton_probably_1996], with estimates from Canadian waters as high as 95 years [@YamanakaandLacko_2001]. `r Spp` was determined to have a vulnerability (V = 2.22) of major concern in a productivity susceptibility analysis [@cope_approach_2011].
