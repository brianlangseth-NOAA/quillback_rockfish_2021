# Assessment Model

## Summary of Previous Assessments 

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2010 to provide estimates of coastwide OFLs ([@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]). The stock was assessed using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) which is a data-limited approach that incorporates catch data with priors on select parameters (natural mortality, stock status in a specified year, productivity, and the relative status of maximum productivity) to estimate overfishing status, but not overfished status. `r Spp` was assessed as a single coastwide stock to generate an overall OFL, that was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. N.. Assuming that current depletion was at the management target on average (e.g. 40%), the 2010 assessment found that `r spp` had a 52% chance of experiencing overfishing coastwide. 

### Bridging Analysis

A direct bridging analysis was not conducted because the previous assessment was structured as a single coastwide model. The previous assessment also used DB-SRA, which uses different assumptions and data than the model used for this assessment, making a bridging analysis intractable.  


## Model Structure and Assumptions

The Oregon `r spp` area was assessed using a one-sex model with life history parameters combined across sexes.  The model assumed two fleets: 1) commercial and 2) recreational fleets with removals beginning in `r startyr`. Selectivity for the commercial fleet was specified to be asymptotic using the double normal parameterization within SS. The ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters were estimated for the commercial fleet.  The recreational fleet also used a double normal parameterization with the ascending slope and size of maximum selectivity parameters estimated, but also was allowed to estimate reduced selectivity for the largest fish (i.e., allowed to be dome-shaped).  Annual recruitment deviations were estimated within the base model.

### Modeling Platform and Structure

Stock Synthesis version 3.30.16 was used to estimate the parameters in the model. The R package r4ss, version 1.41.0, along with R version 4.0.2 were used to investigate and plot model fits. 

### Priors

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model.  The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the Hamel [-@hamel_method_2015] meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 90 years. The prior assumed a log normal distribution for natural mortality. The log normal prior has a median of 0.06 and a standard error of 0.48. 

The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with $\mu$=0.72 and $\sigma$=0.158. The prior parameters are based on the Thorson-Dorn rockfish prior (commonly used in past West Coast rockfish assessments) conducted by James Thorson (personal communication, NWFSC, NOAA) which was reviewed and endorsed by the Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) in 2017. However, this approach was subsequently rejected for future analysis in 2019 when the new meta-analysis resulted in a mean value of approximately 0.95. In the absence of a new method for generating a prior for steepness the default approach reverts to the previously endorsed method, the 2017 value.

### Data Weighting

Length composition data for the comercial fishery started with a sample size determined from the equation listed in Sections \ref{commercial-fishery}. The input sample size for the recreational fishery length composition data was set equal to the number of length samples by year.   

The base  model was weighted using the "Francis method", which was based on equation TA1.8 in Francis [-@francis_data_2011]. This formulation looks at the mean length or age and the variance of the mean to determine if across years, the variability is explained by the model. If the variability around the mean does not encompass the model predictions, then that data source should be down-weighted. This method accounts for correlation in the data (i.e., the multinomial distribution). Sensitivities were performed examining the difference in weighting using McAllister-Ianelli Harmonic Mean Weighting[-@mcallister_bayesian_1997] and the Dirichlet Multinomial Weighting [-@thorson_model-based_2017].

### Estimated and Fixed Parameters

There were 113 estimated parameters in the base model. These included one parameter for $R_0$, 5 parameters for selectivity, 94 recruitment deviations, and 12 forecast recruitment deviations (Table \ref{tab:params}).

Fixed parameters in the model were as follows. Steepness was fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_BH_steep","Value"],2)`. Natural mortality was fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "NatM_p_1_Fem_GP_1","Value"],3)`, which is the median of the prior.  The standard deviation of recruitment deviates was fixed at `r round(model$parameters[model$parameters$Label == "SR_sigmaR","Value"],2)`. Growth, maturity-at-length, and length-at-weight were fixed as described above in Section \ref{data}. Sensitivity analyses and likelihood profiles were performed for steepness, natural mortality, and length at maximum size. 

Dome-shaped selectivity was explored for all fleets within the model.

Older `r spp` are often found in deeper waters and may move into areas that limit their availability to fishing gear. The final base model estimated dome-shaped selectivity for only the largest fish in recent years for the recreational fishery.  The selectivty for the commercial fishery was fixed as asymptotic.


## Model Selection and Evaluation

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, and the goal was to estimate a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off the Oregon coast. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data to estimate reality. A series of investigative model runs were done to achieve the final base model.
