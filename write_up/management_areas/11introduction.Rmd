# Introduction

At the September 2021 Council meeting, the Council requested that the Groundfish Subcommittee (GFSC) evaluate and make recommendations on the stock delineations for copper, quillback, and vermillion/sunset rockfish. Information for copper rockfish was presented at the GFSC mop-up meeting on September 29-30, 2021 (@Wetzel_copper_area_2021). This report updates the information prepared on copper rockfish for application to quillback rockfish. There are few directed studies on quillback rockfish compared to copper rockfish so emphasising quillback rockfish adds limited information beyond that already provided for copper rockfish. To more clearly indicate the information most applicable to quillback rockfish, we have added text to the beginning of the study descriptions to clarify studies that focus on or include quillback rockfish.
