At the September 2021 Council meeting, the Council requested that the Groundfish Subcommittee (GFSC) evaluate and make recommendations on the stock delineations for copper, quillback, and vermillion/sunset rockfish. Information for copper rockfish was presented at the GFSC mop-up meeting on September 29-30, 2021 ({\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}Wetzel (2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). This report updates the information prepared on copper rockfish for application to quillback rockfish. There are few directed studies on quillback rockfish compared to copper rockfish so emphasising quillback rockfish adds limited information beyond that already provided for copper rockfish. To more clearly indicate the information most applicable to quillback rockfish, we have added text to the beginning of the study descriptions to clarify studies that focus on or include quillback rockfish.

Annual recruitment deviations were estimated in the base models for California and Oregon, but not Washington. Overlaying recruitment estimates across areas (using the model sensitivity to estimating annual recruitment deviations for Washington) showed some general coherence with the overall patterns of positive or negative recruitment deviations among areas, with variability in individual years (Figure \ref{fig:recruit-comparison}). In the base model for Washington we opted to not estimate annual recruitment deviations due to limited information available in the length compositions for that area). \emph{Caveat}: Length data may not be fully informative for recruitment as variation in growth can result in low or high recruitment years being attributed to multiple years.

The trajectories across all model areas showed varying patterns (Figure \ref{fig:relb-comparison}). The separate models for the modeled areas estimated different stock trajectories with the stock in California declining earlier, and to a greater degree, than in Oregon or Washington. Both Oregon and California display an increase in stock size starting in the early 2000s that differs in the magnitude of increase, while Washington's change in stock size is much more gradual overall, and seemingly opposite to that of Oregon and California in recent years. The model for Washington did not estimate annual recruitment deviations which likely contributes to stock trajectory differences in recent years (where large recruitment pulses in the 1990s led to increases in recent stock size).

Bosley et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend} also found via simulation that spatial estimation models were generally more robust (i.e.~bias was lower) than assuming non-spatial dynamics, even when the underlying spatial structure of the population was unknown or not present.

Different selectivity curves were estimated between the recreational and commercial fisheries across modeled areas (Figure \ref{fig:selectivity-comparison}). Differences were greater between Oregon and California recreational selectivity than Oregon and Washington. For commercial selectivity, the size at which quillback rockfish began to be selected was similar for Oregon and Washington, but the slope of the selectivity curve was similar for California and Washington.

Bosely et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}: Specifying the correct form of spatial population structure may not be as critical as understanding movement patterns and spatial heterogeneity in fishery selectivity and life-history variation when developing reference points for management.

Berger et al.~{\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2021)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}: Aligning management assessment areas with with underlying population structure and processes is important, especially when fishing mortality is disproportionate to vulnerable biomass among management areas, demographic parameters (growth and maturity) are not homogeneous within management areas, and connectivity (via recruitment or movement) unknowingly exists among management areas. Bias and risk were greater for assessments that incorrectly span multiple population segments compared to assessments that cover a subset of a population segment, and these results were exacerbated when there was connectivity between population segments. \emph{Caveat}: The variation in growth and connectivity between areas via recruitment for quillback rockfish off the West Coast is currently unknown or uncertain.

\tagstructbegin{tag=P}\tagmcbegin{tag=P}

Rather than creating separate assessments to account for variation in exploitation or life-history variation across areas a more integrated approach could be to apply a spatial assessment that can provide both area- and coastwide population estimates. However, spatial assessments come at the cost of a larger number of parameters to estimate, but general guidance around the key decisions exists when moving to spatial assessments (Punt {\tagstructbegin{tag=Reference}\tagmcbegin{tag=Reference}(2019)\leavevmode\tagmcend\tagstructend}). This approach should be evaluated to understand the trade-offs between adding parameters that may be poorly informed (e.g., movement, recruitment by area) via a spatial assessment approach versus either conducting separate assessments or applying the ``fleets-as-areas'' approach.
