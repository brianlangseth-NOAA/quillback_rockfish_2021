# Summary{-}

This rebuilding analysis is for the stock of `r spp` (_`r spp_latin`_) in waters off California. The analysis is based on the 2021 stock assessment [@Langseth_status_2021]. The 2021 assessment model estimated the `r spp` population to be at 14% of the unexploited equilibrium spawning output at the start of 2021. This rebuilding analysis compares the results of applying a suite of potential management actions to the stock for 2025 and beyond based on updated catch values for 2021-2024 as provided by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT). This rebuilding analysis uses the standard suite of management scenarios as described in the rebuilding Terms of Reference [@pfmc_rebuildingTOR_2022] along with two additional SPR strategies at SPR = 0.55 and SPR = 0.65.

The results of the analysis show that the value for $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$, the median year for rebuilding to the target level in the absence of fishing since the year of declaration (2023), is `r reb[[1]]$recovery_spec[4] + reb[[1]]$tmin `. The estimated generation time for `r spp` was `r reb[[1]]$mean_gen` years. In conjunction with $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and the mean generation time, $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$tmax `. An SPR = `r reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants["Yr=Tmid",2]` harvest rate leads to a 50% probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ where $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ was `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants["Yr=Tmid",1]`, an intermediate year between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$.
