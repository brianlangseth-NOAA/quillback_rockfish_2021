# Summary{-}

This rebuilding analysis is for the sub-stock of `r spp` (_`r spp_latin`_) in waters off California. The analysis is based on the 2021 stock assessment [@Langseth_status_2021]. The 2021 assessment model estimated the `r spp` population to be at 14% of the unexploited equilibrium spawning output at the beginning of 2021. This rebuilding analysis compares the results of applying a suite of potential management actions to the stock for 2023 and beyond.

The results of the analysis show that the value for $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$, the median year for rebuilding to the target level in the absence of fishing since the year of declaration (2023), is `r reb[[1]]$recovery_spec[3] + reb[[1]]$tmin `. The estimated generation time for `r spp` was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$mean_gen` years. In conjunction with $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and the mean generation time, $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$tmax `. The SPR = `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants["Yr=Tmid",2]` harvest rate generates a 50% probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ where $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ was set equal to `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants["Yr=Tmid",1]`, an intermediate year between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$.


OWEN COMMENTS TO DO:

In section 4.5: Does this mean 500 for base and 250 for each of the alternatives, or 1000 for each alternative and 2000 for base?

Add ACL run

Add Tmax run to ensure catches are always capped. Maybe add and say it exceeds ABCs

In section 8.3 and Table 2: Again, SPR=.500, 40-10 and ABC rules are not correct. Question remains for the latter two: what do you do? For now perhaps just put in the increasing buffers for those two.

Add results from sensitivity run - confirming ABC caps are also run

Confirm results in 5.2 are accurate, given the ABC caps

Ensure spawning outputs reflect female spawning output
