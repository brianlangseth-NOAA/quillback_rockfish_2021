# Introduction

The 2021 assessment of `r spp` (_`r spp_latin`_) in California waters documented that the population of `r spp` was below the Minimum Stock Size Threshold (MSST), which is 25% of unfished spawning output for rockfish stocks, in 2021 [@Langseth_status_2021]. The population declined below MSST starting in 1992, reached it lowest values in the mid-1990s but increased to near the MSST in the 2000s and early 2010s, and declined in recent years. The stock is expected to be declared overfished for 2023 in 2021. Given the assumed productivity of the stock combined with the longevity of `r spp` a range of alternative rebuilding approaches were examined, and are described in this report, with rebuilding ranging from `r min(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget)` - `r max(reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget)` based on various SPR harvest rates from `r round(min(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[,2], reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants[,2]), 2)` to `r round(max(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[,2], reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants[,2]), 2)` (no harvest). 


# Overview of the 2021 stock assessment

The 2021 assessment of `r spp` assessed the stock as three separate sub-stocks along the U.S. west coast: Washington, Oregon, and California. These were the first assessments of `r spp` conducted within Stock Synthesis [@methot_stock_2013] that used catch and length composition data to inform model estimates around stock size and status. The previous assessment of `r spp` conducted in 2010 was a coastwide assessment modeled using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) to provide estimates of coastwide OFLs using catch data and biological information [@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]. DB-SRA is a catch-only method and does not assess overfished status; the 2010 assessment assumed that current depletion was distributed around the management target of 40%. The 2010 assessment found there was a 52% chance that `r spp` was experiencing overfishing, as recent coastwide catch of `r spp` slightly exceeded the median coastwide OFL estimate at the time. Recent catches of `r spp` for the current assessment also exceed the ACL contributions for the species in all modeled areas. 

Estimates of depletion in 2021 for the sub-stocks off Washington and Oregon were above the MSST threshold, but the estimate of depletion for the sub-stock off California was 14%. See Langseth et al. [-@Langseth_status_2021] for additional results from the California `r spp` base model.

California `r spp` was assessed using a single-sex model with coastwide life history parameters combined across sexes. Life history parameters were estimated externally and then fixed within the model. Natural mortality and steepness were both fixed, at the median and mean of the priors, respectively. Annual recruitment deviations were estimated within the base model. The model for `r spp` in California waters included two fishing fleets, a commercial and a recreational fleet. The majority of the removals and length composition data arose from the recreational fleet. Recreational removals peaked in the late 1970s and early 1980s, with two years of large catches in 1984 and 1993. Removals declined sharply in 1994, but increased to levels similar to the late 1970s and early 1980s during the mid 2000s and again in recent years. Commercial removals peaked in the mid to late 1990s, with one year of exceptionally large catches in 1991. Removals declined through the mid 2010s, but increased in recent years. Selectivity for the commercial and recreational fleets was specified to be asymptotic. The assessment model decision table explored uncertainty around stock size and status using lower ($M$ = 0.0464 yr$^{-1}$) and higher ($M$ = 0.0744 yr$^{-1}$) natural mortality ($M$) values relative to the base model.

Sensitivities to modeling choices, catch history, and parameter values were explored and showed general support for the base model estimates of stock status and depletion. Sensitivities to the von Bertalanffy growth coefficient ($k$, whether estimated on its own or along with $L_\infty$) and natural mortality showed that model estimates of depletion were sensitive to these parameter choices.

This is the first rebuilding plan for `r spp` in waters off the coast of California.
