# Rebuilding calculations

This rebuilding analysis was conducted in September, 2021 using software developed by A. Punt (version 3.12h, August 2021). Input files for the analysis are provided in the [Appendix](#append). The steps followed were: 

\begin{itemize}
	\item Define how equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) will be calculated. 
	\item Define how future recruitment will be generated.
	\item Define the biological information on which future projections will be based.
	\item Define the fishery selectivity and allocation to be applied during rebuilding. 
	\item Decide how to include uncertainty in input parameters from the stock assessment in the rebuilding analysis. 
	\item Calculate rebuilding reference points from the most current assessment results 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Calculate the projected year in which the stock would rebuild with a 50$\%$ probability if all future fishing mortality was eliminated ($\text{T}_\text{F}$=0).
		\item  Calculate the projected year for a 50$\%$ probability of rebuilding from the year in which the stock was first declared overfished ($\text{T}_\text{MIN}$). 
		\item Calculate the mean generation time. 
		\item Calculate the maximum allowable rebuilding time ($\text{T}_\text{MAX}$). 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Identification and analysis of alternative harvest strategies for rebuilding. 
\end{itemize}


## Definition of Equilibrium Spawning Output

The equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) used in this rebuilding analysis is calculated via the stock-recruitment, growth, maturity, and fecundity relationships from the 2021 assessment model in order to be consistent with assessment model results. This level was estimated to be `r round(reb[[1]]$sb0,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs in the base case assessment model, which dictates a rebuilding relative spawning output target ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) of `r round(reb[[1]]$sb40,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs (Table \ref{tab:ref-points}). Estimates of spawning output presented in this report are female spawning output only. 


## Generation of future recruitment

The estimated parameters of the stock recruitment relationship including the unexploited equilibrium recruitment (natural log of $R_0$ = 3.168), steepness ($h$ = 0.72), and degree of recruitment variability ($\sigma_R = 0.60$) from the 2021 assessment were used to generate future recruitments in the rebuilding analysis.


## Population biology

The biological parameters used for the rebuilding analysis were based on the values from the 2021 assessment model. Biological parameters in the assessment were aggregated across sex and constant across time. The rebuilding analysis was based on a single sex model. Biological values are provided in (Table \ref{tab:biology}).


## Fishery selectivity, and removal allocations

The selectivity used in the rebuilding analysis was obtained from the 2021 assessment. Selectivity in the assessment model was constant across time for each fishing fleet. The relative allocation of catch among fleets in the rebuilding analysis was informed using the relative fishing mortality averaged over recent years (2017-2019). This choice provides some consistency between recent model results and forecasts from the rebuilding analysis, and accounts for the unique dynamics in 2020 caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. 


## Inclusion of uncertainty

Model and parameters uncertainty are included in the rebuilding analysis via 1,000 random simulations of stochastic future recruitment strengths and integration over alternative low ($M$ = 0.0464) and high ($M$ = 0.0744) states of nature across values of natural mortality. The base model was given 50% of the weight and each alternative state of nature was given 25% of the weight.

## Alternate rebuilding strategies analyzed

Assuming that a constant rate of harvest will be applied throughout a rebuilding period, the basis for rebuilding alternatives can be divided into two approaches: 1) strategies based on selection of a constant harvest rate (SPR rate), or 2) strategies based on selection of a $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ (year for 50% probability of recovery). This rebuilding analysis presents the following alternate strategies spread among the approaches based on the selection of a SPR harvest rate or rebuilding by a selected target year:  

\begin{itemize}
	\item Eliminate all harvest, F = 0, beginning in the next management cycle, 2023, the same as setting a constant SPR harvest rate of 1.0.
	\item Apply the harvest rate that would generate the ACL specified for the current year (i.e., the latest year specified in regulations).
	\item Apply a range of SPR values: 
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item SPR = 0.50,
	 \item SPR = 0.60,
	 \item SPR = 0.70,
	 \item SPR = 0.80, and
	 \item SPR = 0.90. 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Apply SPR harvest rates that are estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by alternative target years: 
	\begin{itemize}
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$, 
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$, and 
	 \item by other years between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$.
	\end{itemize}
	\item Apply the default harvest policy based on the 40:10 harvest control rule.
	\item Apply the ABC harvest rate with time-varying $\sigma$.
\end{itemize}

No current rebuilding plan exists for `r spp` in California waters so the following alternatives could not be done:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50% probability of recovery by the current $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$.
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50% probability of recovery by the TMAX from the previous cycle.
\end{itemize}

TO DO: Add a harvest policy that would generate the currently specified ACL. There is no ACL, its an ACL contribution. Is this constant catch for every year in the analysis?

All of the above rebuilding strategies were conducted assuming removals of `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2],2)` mt and `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[2,2],2)` mt in 2021 and 2022 as recommended by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT). A sensitivity examining the impact of reducing removals in 2021 and 2022 to the ACL values of 5.83 mt for 2021 and 5.84 mt for 2022 was conducted using only the fixed SPR harvest rate alternatives listed above.

Additionally, the Scientific and Statistical Committee requested a sensitivity examining the impact of blocking recreational and commercial selectivity at 1916-2000 and 2001-2020, assuming asymptotic selectivity for the early block and allowing estimation of dome-shaped selectivity for the later block. This sensitivity was conducted using only F = 0 alternative, and the fixed SPR harvest rate alternatives.
