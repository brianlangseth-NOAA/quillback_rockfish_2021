# Rebuilding calculations

This rebuilding analysis was conducted in August and September, 2023 using software developed by A. Punt (version 3.12j, December 2021). The input file for the analysis is provided in [Appendix A](#append_a). The steps followed were: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define how equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) will be calculated. 
	\item Define how future recruitment will be generated.
	\item Define the biological information on which future projections will be based.
	\item Define the fishery selectivity and allocation to be applied during rebuilding. 
	\item Decide how to include uncertainty in input parameters from the stock assessment in the rebuilding analysis. 
	\item Identification and analysis of alternative harvest strategies for rebuilding. 
\end{enumerate}


## Definition of Equilibrium Spawning Output

The equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) used in this rebuilding analysis is calculated via the stock-recruitment, growth, maturity, and fecundity relationships from the 2021 assessment in order to be consistent with assessment model results. Equilibrium spawning output was estimated to be `r round(reb[[1]]$sb0,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs in the assessment model, which dictates a rebuilding relative spawning output target ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) of `r round(reb[[1]]$sb40,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs (Table \ref{tab:ref-points}). Estimates of spawning output presented in this report are female spawning output only. 


## Generation of future recruitment

The estimated parameters of the stock recruitment relationship including the unexploited equilibrium recruitment (ln($R_0$) = 3.168), steepness ($h$ = 0.72), and degree of recruitment variability ($\sigma_R = 0.60$) from the 2021 assessment were used to generate future recruitments in the rebuilding analysis.


## Population biology

The biological parameters used for the rebuilding analysis were based on the values from the 2021 assessment. Biological parameters in the assessment were aggregated across sex and constant across time. The rebuilding analysis was based on a single sex model. 


## Fishery selectivity, and removal allocations

The selectivity used in the rebuilding analysis was obtained from the 2021 assessment. Selectivity in the assessment model was constant across time for each fishing fleet. The relative allocation of catch among fleets in the rebuilding analysis was informed using the relative fishing mortality from the assessment averaged over recent years (2017--2019). This choice provides some consistency between recent model results and forecasts from the rebuilding analysis, accounting for the unique dynamics in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

Removals for 2021--2024 were entered as fixed values within the analysis and were provided by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT). Removals in these years were allocated among fleets based on the fleet-specific values as provided by the GMT and not based on relative fishery mortality from 2017--2019.   


## Inclusion of uncertainty

Model and parameter uncertainty is included in the rebuilding analysis via 1,000 random simulations of stochastic future recruitment strengths and integration over alternative low ($M$ = 0.0464 yr$^{-1}$) and high ($M$ = 0.0744 yr$^{-1}$) states of nature for values of natural mortality ($M$). Other potential states of nature were explored for the assessment, including for low and high ln($R_0$) and high and low $L_{\infty}$, but alternative values of natural mortality encapsulated a slightly wider range of depletion estimates compared to the other states of natures. The base model was given 50$\%$ of the weight (500 simulations) and each alternative natural mortality state of nature was given 25$\%$ of the weight (250 simulations). 


## Alternate rebuilding strategies analyzed

Assuming that a constant rate of harvest will be applied throughout a rebuilding period, the basis for rebuilding alternatives can be divided into two approaches: 1) strategies based on selection of a constant harvest rate (SPR rate), or 2) strategies based on selection of a target year for 50$\%$ probability of recovery. This rebuilding analysis presents the following alternate strategies, which are a combination of those specified in Section 2.5 of the rebuilding Terms of Reference (TOR; @pfmc_rebuildingTOR_2022) and additional strategies. The additional strategies are based on the selection of a SPR harvest rate, and rebuilding by a selected target year $\text{T}_\text{MID}$.  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Eliminate all harvest, F = 0, starting in the next management cycle, 2025, the same as setting a constant SPR harvest rate of 1.0.
	\item Apply the harvest rate that would generate the ACL contributions specified for the current year (i.e., the latest year specified in regulations). 
	\item Apply a range of SPR values: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item SPR = 0.50,
	 \item SPR = 0.55
	 \item SPR = 0.60,
	 \item SPR = 0.65,
	 \item SPR = 0.70,
	 \item SPR = 0.80, and
	 \item SPR = 0.90. 
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Apply SPR harvest rates that are estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by alternative target years: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ from the current cycle, and 
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ from the current cycle, which is the year midway between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Apply the default harvest policy based on the 40:10 harvest control rule with time-varying sigma ($\sigma$ = 1.0 as the basis for the time-varying sigmas with a cap at the category 3 value of $\sigma$ = 2.0) and $P^*$ = 0.45.
	\item Apply the ABC harvest rate with time-varying sigma ($\sigma$ = 1.0 as the basis for the time-varying sigmas with a cap at the category 3 value of $\sigma$ = 2.0) and $P^*$ = 0.45.
\end{enumerate}

The estimated removal in 2025 from applying an SPR of 0.5 was smaller than the 2024 ACL contributions (`r 0.9573 + 0.9727` mt) for `r spp` in California waters. This implies that an SPR rate of below 0.5 would be needed to achieve the current ACL contributions, so results from this strategy (strategy 2 above) are not provided in this report. The SPR harvest rate to achieve a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ from the current cycle was `r median(reb[[5]]$spr_matrix[,grep("2071", colnames(reb[[5]]$spr_matrix))])`, essentially equal to that of the SPR = 0.5 strategy. Consequently, results fom the $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ strategy (strategy 5a above) are not presented in this report.

No current rebuilding plan exists for `r spp` in California waters so the alternatives related to the results of a previous rebuilding plan as specified in Section 2.5 of the rebuilding TOR could not be done. These include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Apply the spawning potential ratio or relevant harvest control run in the current rebuilding plan (strategy 3 in TOR). 
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by the current $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ (strategy 4 in TOR).
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by the $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ from the previous cycle (strategy 6 in TOR).
\end{itemize}

All of the above rebuilding strategies were conducted assuming removals of `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2],2)` mt in 2021, `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[2,2],2)` mt in 2022, `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,2],2)` mt in 2023, and `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[4,2],2)` mt in 2024, as recommended by the GMT.
