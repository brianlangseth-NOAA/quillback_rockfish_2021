# Rebuilding calculations

This rebuilding analysis was conducted in September, 2021 using software developed by A. Punt (version 3.12h, August 2021). The input file for the analysis is provided in [Appendix A](#append_a). The steps followed were: 

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Define how equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) will be calculated. 
	\item Define how future recruitment will be generated.
	\item Define the biological information on which future projections will be based.
	\item Define the fishery selectivity and allocation to be applied during rebuilding. 
	\item Decide how to include uncertainty in input parameters from the stock assessment in the rebuilding analysis. 
	\item Identification and analysis of alternative harvest strategies for rebuilding. 
\end{enumerate}


## Definition of Equilibrium Spawning Output

The equilibrium spawning output ($\text{SB}_0$) used in this rebuilding analysis is calculated via the stock-recruitment, growth, maturity, and fecundity relationships from the 2021 assessment in order to be consistent with assessment model results. Equilibrium spawning output was estimated to be `r round(reb[[1]]$sb0,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs in the assessment model, which dictates a rebuilding relative spawning output target ($\text{SB}_{40\%}$) of `r round(reb[[1]]$sb40,2)*frac_fem` millions of eggs (Table \ref{tab:ref-points}). Estimates of spawning output presented in this report are female spawning output only. 


## Generation of future recruitment

The estimated parameters of the stock recruitment relationship including the unexploited equilibrium recruitment (natural log of $R_0$ = 3.168), steepness ($h$ = 0.72), and degree of recruitment variability ($\sigma_R = 0.60$) from the 2021 assessment were used to generate future recruitments in the rebuilding analysis.


## Population biology

The biological parameters used for the rebuilding analysis were based on the values from the 2021 assessment. Biological parameters in the assessment were aggregated across sex and constant across time. The rebuilding analysis was based on a single sex model. 
<!-- Biological values used as input into the rebuilding analysis are provided in (Table \ref{tab:biology-base}). -->


## Fishery selectivity, and removal allocations

The selectivity used in the rebuilding analysis was obtained from the 2021 assessment. Selectivity in the assessment model was constant across time for each fishing fleet. The relative allocation of catch among fleets in the rebuilding analysis was informed using the relative fishing mortality from the assessment averaged over recent years (2017-2019). This choice provides some consistency between recent model results and forecasts from the rebuilding analysis, accounting for the unique dynamics in 2020 caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 


## Inclusion of uncertainty

Model and parameter uncertainty is included in the rebuilding analysis via 1,000 random simulations of stochastic future recruitment strengths and integration over alternative low ($M$ = 0.0464 yr$^{-1}$) and high ($M$ = 0.0744 yr$^{-1}$) states of nature for values of natural mortality ($M$). Other potential states of nature were explored for the assessment, including for low and high ln($R_0$) and high and low $L_{\infty}$, but alternative values of natural mortality encapsulated a slightly wider range of depletion estimates compared to the other states of natures. The base model was given 50% of the weight (500 simulations) and each alternative natural mortality state of nature was given 25% (250 simulations) of the weight. 


## Alternate rebuilding strategies analyzed

Assuming that a constant rate of harvest will be applied throughout a rebuilding period, the basis for rebuilding alternatives can be divided into two approaches: 1) strategies based on selection of a constant harvest rate (SPR rate), or 2) strategies based on selection of a $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ (year for 50% probability of recovery). This rebuilding analysis presents the following alternate strategies, which are a combination of those specified in the rebuilding Terms of Reference (TOR; PFMC -@TOR_2020) and additional strategies. The additional strategies are based on the selection of a SPR harvest rate or rebuilding by a selected target year.  

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Eliminate all harvest, F = 0, starting in the next management cycle, 2023, the same as setting a constant SPR harvest rate of 1.0.
	\item Apply the harvest rate that would generate the ACL contributions specified for the current year (i.e., the latest year specified in regulations). 
	\item Apply a range of SPR values: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item SPR = 0.50,
	 \item SPR = 0.60,
	 \item SPR = 0.70,
	 \item SPR = 0.80, and
	 \item SPR = 0.90. 
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Apply SPR harvest rates that are estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by alternative target years: 
	\begin{enumerate}
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ from the current cycle, and 
	 \item by $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ from the current cycle, which is the year midway between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item Apply the default harvest policy based on the 40:10 harvest control rule with time-varying sigma ($\sigma$ = 1.0 as the basis for the time-varying sigmas) and $P^*$ = 0.45.
	\item Apply the ABC harvest rate with time-varying sigma ($\sigma$ = 1.0 as the basis for the time-varying sigmas) and $P^*$ = 0.45.
\end{enumerate}

The sum of ACL contributions for `r spp` from the southern management area and the percent allocation for California (28.7$\%$) in the northern management area as provided by the Groundfish Management Team (GMT) were larger than the catch resulting from applying an SPR of 0.5, implying an SPR rate of below 0.5 for this run, so results from this run are not provided in this report. Similarly, the SPR rate that led to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ was less than 0.5 so results from the $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ strategy are not presented in this report.

No current rebuilding plan exists for `r spp` in California waters so the alternatives related to the results of a previous rebuilding plan as specified in the rebuilding TOR could not be done. These include:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Apply the spawning potential ratio or relevant harvest control run in the current rebuilding plan. 
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by the current $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$.
 \item Apply the harvest rate that is estimated to lead to a 50$\%$ probability of recovery by the $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ from the previous cycle.
\end{itemize}

All of the above rebuilding strategies were conducted assuming removals of `r round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[1,2],2)` mt in 2021 and 2022 as recommended by the GMT.

The Pacific Fishery Management Council's (Council) Scientific and Statistical Committee (SSC) requested at the September Council meeting that an additional rebuilding sensitivity be conducted examining the impact of blocking both recreational and commercial selectivity at 1916-2000 and 2001-2020, assuming asymptotic selectivity for the early blocks and allowing estimation of dome-shaped selectivity for the recent blocks. This sensitivity was conducted without integration over alternative states of nature for natural mortality, given its treatment as a sensitivity. 
<!-- The biological parameters on which the projections are based for this sensitivity are provided in [Appendix B](#append_b) (Table \ref{tab:biology-sens}). -->
