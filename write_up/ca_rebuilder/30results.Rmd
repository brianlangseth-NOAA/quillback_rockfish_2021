## Rebuilding reference points

Reference points calculated based on this rebuilding analysis are given in Table \ref{tab:ref-points}. The minimum time required for rebuilding, $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$, with no fishing (F=0) starting in 2023 was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$recovery_spec[1] ` years, corresponding to the stock being rebuilt by `r reb[[1]]$recovery_spec[4] + reb[[1]]$tmin `, assuming the default removals for 2021 and 2022.  The mean generation time was estimated to be `r reb[[1]]$mean_gen ` years. The maximum time allowed for rebuilding, $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$, is defined as the $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ plus the mean generation time for stocks that require more than 10 years to rebuild.  `r Spp` was unable to rebuild within 10 years so the estimated $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ was `r reb[[1]]$tmax `. $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$, and $\text{SPR}_\text{TARGET}$ are not specified since this is the first rebuilding plan for `r spp` and these values have not been set via the Council's process.

A rebuilding strategy is presented below and includes a rebuilding target year termed $\text{T}_\text{MID}$, which equals `r reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants[6,1]` and is the mid-point between $\text{T}_\text{MIN}$ and $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$. The Council may opt to select a $\text{T}_\text{TARGET}$ earlier or later than this $\text{T}_\text{MID}$ value based on fishery, economic, or other factors.

## Alternative harvest policy projections

Summary results from the rebuilding alternatives are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-options}. Results from the ramp-down strategies are presented in Table \ref{tab:reb-ramp-options}. In Tables \ref{tab:reb-options} and \ref{tab:reb-ramp-options}, non-fixed catch values for 2023-2025 are labeled as ACL values. Detailed results for all runs are presented in Tables \ref{tab:prob-mat}-\ref{tab:rel-ssb-mat} and Figures \ref{fig:prob-fig}-\ref{fig:ssb-fig}.

The target rebuilding year based on the various rebuilding strategies ranged from `r min(reb[[1]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget)` - `r max(reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget)` (Tables \ref{tab:reb-options} and \ref{tab:reb-ramp-options}). The probability of rebuilding by year steadily increased across the alternative SPR values with full rebuilding (reaching a probability of greater than 50%) by `r max(reb[[2]]$rebuild_quants$Ttarget)` when the lowest SPR of 0.50 was applied (Table \ref{tab:prob-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:prob-fig}). The recommended removals in 2023, the first year of rebuilding, were low ranging between `r min(round(reb[[1]]$acl_matrix[3,-c(1,8)],2))` - `r max(round(reb[[2]]$acl_matrix[3,2:6],2))` mt across strategies excluding the no-harvest strategy (Table \ref{tab:acl-mat}), with the recommended removals slowly increasing by year during the rebuilding period (Figure \ref{fig:acl-fig}). The estimated overfishing limits (OFLs) for each rebuilding alternative are given in Table \ref{tab:ofl-mat}. The change in spawning output by year relative to the spawning output target, 40% of unfished, under each of the alternatives are shown by year in Table \ref{tab:rel-ssb-mat} and Figure \ref{fig:rel-ssb-fig}. The harvest rate to obtain a 50% probability of recovery by $\text{T}_\text{MAX}$ corresponds to an SPR that is lower than 0.5, which represents catch that is greater than the OFL, so is not provided in the tables.
