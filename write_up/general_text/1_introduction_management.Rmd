## Summary of Management History and Performance

`r Spp` is managed by the Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) as a part of the Minor Nearshore Rockfish North and Minor Nearshore Rockfish South complexes. The North and South complexes are split at N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. off the U.S. West Coast. Each complex is managed based on a complex-level overfishing limit (OFL) and annual catch limit (ACL) that are determined by summing the species-specific OFL and ACL (ACLs set equal to the Acceptable Biological Catch) contributions for all stocks managed in the complex. Removals for species within each complex are managed and tracked against the complex total OFL and ACL, rather than on a species by species basis.

`r Spp` was most recently assessed in 2010 using Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis (DB-SRA) to provide estimates of coastwide OFLs [@DickandMacCall_dbsra_2010]. The coastwide OFL was then apportioned to each management area based on the proportion of historical catches North and South of N. 40$^\circ$ 10' Lat. DB-SRA does not assess overfished status, but rather assumes that current depletion is distributed around the management target (e.g. 40%). The 2010 assessment found there was a 52% chance that `r spp` was experiencing overfishing, as recent coastwide catch of `r spp` slightly exceeded the median coastwide OFL estimate at the time.
